## 721. Knee-high to a grasshopper

grasshopper：美 [ˈɡræshɑːpər] 蚱蜢；蝗虫

knee-high：齐膝高的；膝盖高度的；

“像蚱蜢一样高” 或 “非常小，非常年轻”。

这个短语用以形容一个人非常小或非常年轻，起源于蚱蜢的高度比喻。蚱蜢通常非常小，因此当形容一个人为 “knee-high to a grasshopper” 时，就是在说这个人年纪小或者个子矮，通常用于反映某个时间点的人的幼小时期。

This idiom is used to describe someone who is very small or very young, deriving from the comparison to the height of a grasshopper. Grasshoppers are generally very small, so saying someone is “knee-high to a grasshopper” indicates they were young or short at the time, often used to reflect on someone’s childhood.

- I’ve known her since she was *knee-high to a grasshopper*.我从她非常小的时候就认识她了。

- He’s been playing the piano since he was *knee-high to a grasshopper*.他从非常小的时候就开始弹钢琴了。

- I remember being *knee-high to a grasshopper* and helping my grandpa in the garden.我记得我小时候就帮助爷爷在花园里干活。

## 722. Knee-jerk reaction

knee-jerk：膝腱反射；本能地做出的；未经思考做出的；条件反射的

“膝跳反应” 或 “条件反射”。

这个短语起源于医生在检查膝反射时，膝盖会不由自主地跳动，这个反应不需要大脑思考就发生了。因此，“knee-jerk reaction” 用来形容一种未经深思熟虑的、自动化的反应，通常是对某个刺激或情况的立即反应。

This phrase originates from the medical knee reflex test, where the knee involuntarily jerks upon being tapped. This reaction happens without the need for conscious thought. Therefore, “knee-jerk reaction” is used to describe an automatic, often unconsidered response to a stimulus or situation.

- Her *knee-jerk reaction* was to say no to the unexpected proposal.她的条件反射是拒绝那个出乎意料的提议。

- Instead of having a *knee-jerk reaction*, take a moment to think it through.不要有条件反射般的反应，花点时间好好想一想。

- He regretted his *knee-jerk reaction* of anger later.他后来后悔了自己当时条件反射般的愤怒反应。

## 723. Knock into a cocked hat

cocked hat：三角帽；折叠帽；歪戴的帽子；

“彻底击败” 或 “彻底粉碎”。

这个短语源于传统的三角帽（三角船帽或鸡冠帽），在摔倒后形状变得歪斜和没用。它隐喻某事被彻底摧毁或被压倒性的胜利所击败。这个表达常用于描述某个想法、计划或竞争对手被完全击败或摧毁。

This phrase originates from the traditional tricorn hat (*cocked hat*), which becomes disheveled and useless when knocked out of shape. It metaphorically signifies something being thoroughly destroyed or overwhelmingly defeated. This idiom is often used to describe an idea, plan, or competitor being completely overcome or ruined.

- The new evidence knocked their theory into a cocked hat.新的证据彻底粉碎了他们的理论。

- The underdog team knocked the champions into a cocked hat.这支弱旅彻底击败了冠军队。

## 724. Knock it off

“别闹了” 或 “停止做某事”。

这个短语起源于 20 世纪初的美国俚语，通常用来要求某人停止做某种令人讨厌或分心的行为。它通常在非正式的对话中使用，特别是在试图让朋友或孩子停止打扰或扰乱时。

This phrase originates from early 20th-century American slang, and is commonly used to tell someone to stop doing something annoying or distracting. It is typically used in informal conversations, especially when trying to get friends or children to stop being disruptive or bothersome.

## 725. Knock on wood

“敲木头” 或 “祈求好运”。

这个短语有好几种起源说法，其中一种是，古欧洲人认为树木和森林拥有神秘的力量，因此敲击木头可以唤起或感应到这些力量来保护自己。在现代使用中，当人们说了某件好事情或者希望某事顺利进行，会通过 “敲木头” 来避免不好的事情发生，是一种祈求好运的迷信行为。

This phrase has several origin theories. One popular belief is that ancient Europeans thought trees and forests held mystical powers. Therefore, touching or knocking on wood would invoke or signal these powers for protection. In modern usage, after mentioning something positive or hoping for something to proceed smoothly, people knock on wood to ward off bad luck — a superstitious act of seeking good fortune.

- I’ve never gotten a speeding ticket, *knock on wood*.我从来没有被开过超速罚单，敲木头（希望这样一直下去）。

- We have had great weather for our trip so far, *knock on wood*.我们这次旅行的天气很好，敲木头（希望天气继续保持良好）。

这个短语起源于美国，最早可以追溯到 19 世纪后期。其原意是指某个打击（通常是物理上的）强烈到可以把人鞋子打飞甚至袜子也打飞。但在现代使用中，它更多的是指某人或者某事给人留下深刻的印象，常常是出乎意料的好。

This phrase originated in America, dating back to the late 19th century. Originally, it was used to describe a blow so powerful that it could knock off a person’s shoes and even their socks.

这个短语表达了对某事物非常熟悉、了解所有的细节和流程的意思。它由两个部分组成：“*ins*” 指内部情况，和 “*outs*” 指外部情况，合起来表示对所有方面都了如指掌。

The phrase expresses familiarity with all details and procedures of something. It is composed of two parts: “*ins*” refers to internal details, and “*outs*” refers to external details, together indicating a thorough understanding of all aspects.

“熟悉门道” 或 “了解内情”。

这个短语源于早期航海术语。在航海中，船员们需要知道如何掌握和使用船上的许多绳子，这对于有效地操纵船只至关重要。因此，一个 “知道绳索” 的船员被认为是有经验且可靠的。在现代，“*know the ropes*” 通常用来形容某人对某一领域非常熟悉，知道其中的规矩和技巧。

This phrase originates from early nautical terminology. In sailing, sailors needed to know how to handle and use the many ropes on a ship, which was crucial for effectively maneuvering the vessel. Thus, a sailor who “*knew the ropes*” was considered experienced and reliable. In modern times, “*know the ropes*” is generally used to describe someone who is very familiar with the rules, tasks, and subtleties of a certain field.

- After a few weeks on the job, you’ll start to *know the ropes*.在工作了几周后，你会开始熟悉门道。

This phrase originates from maritime terminology, where knowing the wind direction is crucial for navigation. Metaphorically, “know which way the wind is blowing” describes someone who can effectively understand the current situation, trend, or social climate and make decisions accordingly.

## 730. Know your onions

“非常精通某事” 或 “非常了解自己的领域”。

这个短语的起源并不十分明确，有人认为它可能与 20 世纪初英国某著名家庭菜谱作家 S. G. Onyons 的名字有关，然而这种解释仍存在争议。总体而言，这个短语用来表示某人对某一领域有深厚的理解和专业知识。

This phrase’s origin is somewhat unclear; some suggest it might be related to S. G. Onyons, a renowned British household cookbook author from the early 20th century, though this interpretation is debated.

## 731. Know zip

“知道零” 或 “一无所知”。

这个短语中的 “*zip*” 是一个俚语，意思是 “零” 或 “没有”，由此引申出 “*know zip*” 表示完全不知道某事。这个说法源自于 “零分” 在考试或比赛中的用法，通过表示数量的 “零” 来隐喻知识的缺乏。

This phrase comes from the slang usage of “*zip*” to mean “*zero*” or “nothing,” hence “*know zip*” implies knowing nothing about something. The analogy is drawn from the concept of getting “*zero*” in a test or competition, symbolizing a lack of knowledge.

- I know zip about repairing cars.我对修车一无所知。

- She knows zip about cooking but wants to learn.她对做饭一无所知，但是想要学习。

“屈服” 或 “让步”。

这个短语来源于一个古老的习惯，即人们在下棋或其他游戏时，当一个人认输时，会把手指关节摆在棋盘上以示屈服。随着时间的推移，“knuckle under” 逐渐演变成了一种表示屈服或让步的表达。

This idiom originates from an old practice in games like chess, where a player would place their knuckles on the board to signify defeat. Over time, “*knuckle under*” has evolved to mean yielding or giving in.

“出于爱好或热情的工作” 或 “心甘情愿的付出”。

这个短语的起源是因为人们会为了自己热爱的事物或人而无偿地投入大量的时间和精力，而不仅仅是为了薪酬或回报。在这种情况下，劳动本身因为热情或爱的存在而变得值得，而不仅仅是一种负担。

This idiom originates because people tend to invest a lot of time and effort for something they love or are passionate about, often without expecting payment or reward. In such situations, the labor itself becomes worthwhile due to the presence of love or passion, rather than being just a burden.

## 734. Laid off

“被裁员” 或 “被解雇”。

这个短语起源于公司在经济不景气或需求减少时，选择暂时或永久性解雇员工。和 “*fired*” 不同，“*laid off*” 通常不是由于员工表现不佳，而是因为公司本身的原因，如重组、预算削减等，无法继续提供工作岗位。

This phrase originates from situations where companies temporarily or permanently dismiss employees due to economic downturns or decreased demand. Unlike “fired,” “*laid off*” is typically not due to the employee’s poor performance but rather due to the company’s circumstances such as restructuring, budget cuts, etc.
