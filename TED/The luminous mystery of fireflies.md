## Summary



Wan Faridah Akmal Jusoh, a firefly scientist from Terengganu, Malaysia, grew up in a superstitious and conservative community with various rules, such as returning home before sunset. This instilled a sense of mystery about the night, which later drew her towards nature and led to her fascination with fireflies, or "kelip-kelip." Her first encounter with them during a nighttime boat ride through a mangrove forest solidified her passion for these insects, leading her to a 17-year career researching fireflies and their critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems.

Fireflies, with over 2,000 species worldwide, are more than just beautiful lights; they are bioindicators of ecosystem health. Different species exhibit unique light patterns, and their life cycles help balance the ecosystem. Firefly population declines often signal broader environmental issues like water quality degradation or light pollution. Wan Faridah emphasizes the importance of preserving firefly habitats to maintain ecological balance and prevent adverse climate effects.

Despite challenges, including encounters with dangerous wildlife, Wan Faridah's dedication to discovering and studying fireflies remains unwavering. Her work led to the identification of a new firefly species, Luciola singapura, in Singapore. As an educator and cochair of the IUCN Firefly Specialist Group, she advocates for global collaboration to conserve firefly species. She invites others to join her mission to protect these vital insects before they vanish, highlighting the urgency of conservation efforts.



Wan Faridah Akmal Jusoh 是一位来自马来西亚登嘉楼的萤火虫科学家。她在一个迷信和保守的社区长大，生活中有许多奇怪的规矩，比如必须在日落前回家。这些规矩让她对夜晚充满了神秘感，后来她对大自然产生了浓厚的兴趣，尤其是萤火虫（当地称为“kelip-kelip”）。她第一次在红树林中夜晚乘船旅行时遇到萤火虫，深深被这些小昆虫迷住，这次经历促使她投身于长达17年的萤火虫研究，并意识到它们在维持健康生态系统中的重要作用。

萤火虫在全球有超过2000种，不仅仅是美丽的发光昆虫，它们也是生态系统健康的生物指标。不同种类的萤火虫有独特的发光模式，它们的生命周期有助于维持生态平衡。当萤火虫数量减少时，通常表明环境问题，如水质恶化或光污染。Wan Faridah 强调保护萤火虫栖息地的重要性，以保持生态平衡并防止不良的气候影响。

尽管面临许多挑战，包括与危险野生动物的遭遇，Wan Faridah 对发现和研究萤火虫的热情从未减退。她的工作促成了新萤火虫物种——Luciola singapura——在新加坡的发现。作为教育家和IUCN萤火虫专家组的联合主席，她倡导全球合作保护萤火虫物种。她邀请大家加入她的使命，在这些重要的昆虫消失之前保护它们，强调了保护工作迫在眉睫的重要性。



## Transcript



I was born in Terengganu,

a beautiful coastal state
in Peninsular Malaysia.

Growing up in a superstitious,
conservative community,

my siblings and I always
had to follow the strangest rules

that usually didn't make sense to me.

Things like: don't whistle in the house,

no nail clipping at night.

And whenever we went out to play,

we had to return home before sunset

or before it got dark.

This particular rule
made the night seem mysterious to me.

I spent my school year admiring the dark,

but never got around
to really exploring it.

As I got older, I was really drawn
to beautiful nature.

While in mangrove forests,

a forestry officer
told me about kelip-kelip.

A group of insects that can produce light

that are easiest to see at night.

Given my limited experience
with darkness --

(Laughter)

I decided to take a boat ride
across the mangrove estuary one night

just to see what they look like.

Well, the first 15 minutes
of the journey was frightening.

It was pitch-black out there,
and the river was choppy.

All I could hear was a faint breeze.

As the river began to narrow,

it was then that I noticed
a mesmerizing sight.

Countless tiny flashes of light
started to flicker on the trees,

all flashing in almost perfect unison.

It was as if they were dancing
to their own beat.

That is the moment I will never forget.

The moment I officially
fell in love with kelip-kelip,

known as fireflies in English.

(Laughter)

The rest is history.

Now, I have been researching fireflies
for more than 17 years,

and I plan to spend my life

uncovering and supporting
the worlds of these creatures.

(Applause)

There are more than 2,000
firefly species that we know of,

and they live all over the world.

They are found in every continent
except for Antarctica.

Most of them have wings,
and most species can emit light.

The light is produced
by special organs under their abdomens,

and each species
has its own unique light pattern.

Some glow continuously,

while others emit
discreet flashing patterns,

almost like a secret code.

Fireflies are so much more
than just pretty lights.

They are an essential part
of a healthy ecosystem.

The life cycle of fireflies

keeps the ecosystem balanced.

Each firefly species
in its [respective] life stage

has specific needs
for a habitat to thrive.

They act as bioindicator

to ascertain whether
a particular habitat is healthy or not.

For example, in a mangrove forest,

when you see a population
of fireflies decreasing,

that could be due
to water quality degradation,

which can be a sign
of a collapsing food chain.

Why? Because firefly larvae eat snails,

and snails need
good water quality to thrive.

In terrestrial habitats,

firefly population declines
can be attributed to light pollution.

They are extremely sensitive
to artificial light

because this type of light

can disorient, repel

or blind them.

So most of the time when you see
a decline in firefly population,

you can bet other species
that live in the same habitat

in which fireflies are found
are also declining.

This is indicative
of an unhealthy ecosystem.

This is bad for us, humans, too.

It is a sign of overdevelopment

that can induce climate effects
such as flood and drought.

As I delve deeper
into the world of fireflies,

I can't help but wonder

the fascinating mysteries
that unfolded before me.

It amazed me to learn
that some firefly species

prefer to fly solo in forests,

searching for light signals
from their nonwinged mates,

while others
choose to gather amongst trees

where the ocean meets the land.

Equally intriguing is the fact
that some firefly species have larvae

that dwell in slow-moving
rivers and ponds,

while others have larvae
that stay on land.

I find it inspiring.

I find it inspiring to know

that there are so many undiscovered
species hiding within them.

Imagine how many more
remarkable firefly species

are waiting to be found.

And I have always wanted to find them.

(Laughter)

But it can be hard.

There are other
dangerous animals, too, at night.

(Laughter)

On one occasion, when I was
in a place called Linggi,

I stopped at a tree with firefly colonies
to collect a few specimens.

When we turned on our headlamps,

we saw a row of red eyes.

And soon we realized

that we were surrounded by crocodiles.

Audience: Oh!

Sometimes the discovery of new species

can be prompted by examining collections

in the Natural History Museum.

In 2016, I went to Singapore

and studied a firefly collection
from Southeast Asia

at Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum.

I saw a firefly specimen
lying in the collection

that did not match
any of the descriptions that I knew of.

There’s no name attached to it,
and nobody knew what it was.

In fact, the first specimen
of this unknown species

was collected in 1989.

That is akin to a human adult
living up to 30 years

without a name

and without a proper description
of this person.

(Laughter)

So my colleagues and I
in 2018 went on a mission.

We coordinated the first night survey
to the habitat of this unknown firefly,

which happens to be the last remaining
freshwater swamp in Singapore.

We spent three hours exploring

only to be greeted by the empty darkness.

We went home disappointed and tired.

Not to mention
dirty and smelly from the mud.

We went in again three months later.

Still nothing.

At this point we thought, this is it.

The species is gone for good.

However,

the third time's the charm.

During the third time visit to this swamp,

we saw a few tiny flashes

start to show up and perch on ferns.

It was such an amazing feeling

despite having to wade through
the muddy, swampy waters

and being feasted on by mosquitoes.

The itchiness was still worth it.

(Laughter)

After two years of additional
data collection and analysis,

we confirmed that this unknown
firefly species was new to science.

(Applause)

It was also the first time
since over a century

that a new species of firefly,

a luminous firefly
from Singapore, was found.

And so we named it Luciola singapura.

There is a Malay saying.

(Speaks Malay)

"If you are going
to reach into the pickle jar,

might as well put your whole arm in."

(Laughter)

The further I have gone into this work
as researcher and educator

in the field of biodiversity
and conservation

at Monash University Malaysia,

the more passionate I have become.

I have transformed from a girl,
a curious girl,

wanting to know what kelip-kelip is,

to a driven scientist

committed to safeguarding
the fireflies of the world.

The problem is that firefly habitats
are disappearing fast.

We are now in a race against time
to name species before they disappear.

I am a cochair of the IUCN
Firefly Specialist Group,

but it is also my personal mission

to collaborate, to work together
with firefly lovers and stakeholders

to identify and conserve
threatened firefly species everywhere.

Here's a flash of hope.

Join me on this journey if you are keen.

Fireflies need your help

before they flash that one last time.

Thank you.

(Applause)
