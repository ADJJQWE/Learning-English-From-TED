## Chapter 4: Economic Power and Corporate Influence 

原文：

In the late eighteenth century, the Founders worked **against a backdrop of** mercantilism, nascent capitalism, and small-scale commerce that revolved primarily around family-owned farms, local artisans, and modest mercantile **ventures**. They viewed economic liberty as a cornerstone of the new republic, an essential ingredient in the grand experiment of self-government. The aim was to ensure that no single concentration of economic or political power could **strangle** the **civic sphere** or dominate public life. Safeguarding an economic environment in which citizens could prosper without succumbing to the dominance of **monied interests** was, in their minds, **part and parcel** of securing liberty. Today’s America, however, is defined by massive corporate conglomerates operating on a global scale, and the interplay between government policy and corporate influence is a far cry from the relatively limited commercial enterprises the Founders knew. Were they to examine modern America’s economic structure, they would have to grapple with this transformation, asking how concentrated economic power might reshape the balance of interests they so carefully attempted to cultivate.

在 18 世纪晚期，美国的创始人在重商主义、资本主义萌芽以及以家庭农场、本地手工业者和小规模商贸活动为主的背景下开展工作。他们将经济自由视为新共和国的基石，是自我治理这一伟大实验中不可或缺的要素。其目标是确保没有任何单一的经济或政治权力能够**扼杀**公民生活或支配公共生活。在他们看来，保护一个经济环境，使公民得以繁荣而不至于屈服于**金钱利益集团**的主导，是保障自由的**核心要素**。

然而，今天的美国以全球规模运作的大型企业集团为特征，政府政策与企业影响之间的互动，与创始人所熟悉的有限商业活动大相径庭。如果他们审视现代美国的经济结构，必然要面对这一转变，并探究经济权力的集中如何可能重塑他们精心设计的利益平衡。

First, they would likely be struck by the sheer scale of corporate entities. In their era, the largest business ventures—whether **shipping houses**, early banks, or trade companies—were still confined by geography, capital constraints, and slower methods of communication and production. These enterprises lacked the capacity to reorder entire markets or wield near-sovereign authority over supply chains spanning continents. The Founders understood trade well enough, and some, like Alexander Hamilton, even envisioned a robust commercial republic. However, none could have imagined corporations with multi-trillion-dollar valuations, vast research and development capabilities, and the ability to influence consumer behavior and information flow at a global level. The notion that a handful of private entities could wield influence comparable to nation-states would **startle** them, pushing them to question the boundaries that separate the public and private spheres.

首先，他们很可能会对企业实体的庞大规模感到震惊。在他们的时代，最大的商业企业——无论是**航运公司**、早期银行还是贸易公司——都受到地理限制、资本约束以及较慢的通讯和生产方式的制约。这些企业没有能力重塑整个市场或在跨洲供应链上行使近乎主权的权力。

创始人对贸易非常了解，其中一些人（如亚历山大·汉密尔顿）甚至设想了一个强大的商业共和国。然而，他们谁也无法想象今天的企业拥有数万亿美元的估值、庞大的研发能力，以及在全球范围内影响消费者行为和信息流动的力量。

少数私人实体的影响力堪比国家的概念将会**震惊**他们，促使他们质疑公共领域与私人领域之间的界限是否依然清晰。

shipping houses：航运公司

>
>
>**Shipping houses**
>**意思**：**“航运公司”** 或 **“贸易运输公司”**，指专门从事海运贸易和货物运输的企业。
>**例句**：
>
>- "In the 18th century, shipping houses played a crucial role in global commerce."
>  在 18 世纪，航运公司在全球贸易中发挥了关键作用。
>- "The growth of shipping houses supported colonial economies."
>  航运公司的发展促进了殖民经济的增长。
>  **文中用法**：描述创始人所处时代规模较小、受地域限制的商业机构。

startle：美 [ˈstɑːrtl] 使惊吓；使大吃一惊；使吓一跳；
>**Startle**
>**意思**：**“使震惊”** 或 **“惊讶”**，强调对意想不到的事物感到惊讶或不安。
>**例句**：
>
>- "The sudden explosion startled the crowd."
>  突然的爆炸声吓到了人群。

原文：

Second, they would scrutinize the legal frameworks that have granted corporations rights and privileges once reserved for citizens. In the founding era, corporations were **chartered** by states for specific, limited purposes—building roads, canals, or **public works**—and their existence was not assumed to be perpetual. Over time, the legal status of corporations evolved, **culminating** in a broad range of protections for corporate entities. The Supreme Court’s interpretations, which have often extended certain constitutional protections to corporations, would likely puzzle the Founders. To them, the Constitution was a document crafted to secure the rights and liberties of individuals. Recognizing corporations as holders of such rights, particularly when this status allows them to **deploy wealth** as a form of speech or to influence public policy, would seem like an **inversion** of the original intentions of constitutional protections.

其次，他们会仔细审视赋予企业权利和特权的法律框架，这些权利和特权曾经只属于公民。在创立时期，公司是由各州**授权**设立的，目的通常是为了特定的、有限的用途——如建设道路、运河或公共设施——且它们的存在并不被假设为永久性的。随着时间的推移，公司的法律地位逐渐演变，最终形成了对公司实体的广泛保护。

最高法院的判决，尤其是那些将宪法某些保护延伸至公司权益的解释，可能会让创始人感到困惑。对他们来说，宪法是为了保障个人的权利和自由而制定的。承认公司拥有这些权利，尤其是在这种地位使它们能够将财富作为一种言论形式，或通过财富影响公共政策时，似乎是在**反转**宪法保护最初的意图。

学习：

chartered: 授权

>**Chartered**
>**意思**：**“授权”** 或 **“授予特许状”**，指政府或权威机构授予某个实体（如公司）合法资格或特许经营权。

>  这家公司获得了州政府的特许，负责建设一座桥梁。
>- "In the past, many businesses were chartered to provide public services."
>  过去，许多企业是被特许来提供公共服务的。
>  **文中用法**：指当时的公司通过州政府授权来从事特定的、有限的活动。

culminating: 最终形成

>**Culminating**
>**意思**：**“达到顶点”** 或 **“最终形成”**，指某事物发展到最高潮或最终结果。
>**例句**：
>
>- "The event culminated in a spectacular fireworks display."
>  该事件以壮观的烟花表演作为高潮。
>- "His efforts culminated in the creation of a new law."
>  他的努力最终促成了一项新法律的出台。
>  **文中用法**：指公司在法律地位上的演变达到了一个阶段，获得了广泛的法律保护。

canals：美 [kəˈnælz] 运河；水道；气管；沟渠；（canal的复数） **注意发音**

public works：公共工程；市政工程；公共建设；公共设施；公用事业          

deploy wealth:

>1. Deploy wealth意思：“利用财富”，指利用大量的资金或资源达到某种目的，尤其是用于影响政治或舆论等。
>
>   例句：
>
>   - "Corporations often deploy wealth to shape public opinion through advertising."
>     企业常常通过广告来利用财富影响公众舆论。
>   - "Political campaigns deploy wealth to influence voters."
>     政治竞选活动利用财富来影响选民。
>     **文中用法**：指企业将其财富用作“言论”的一种形式，影响公共政策。

Third, the Founders would consider the immense influence these economic behemoths exert on public policy. Although special interests existed in the early republic—ranging from landed gentry to maritime merchants—today’s lobbying networks and the financial resources **at their disposal** dwarf anything the Founders could have imagined. The modern political landscape, where corporate influence helps shape regulations, **tax codes**, environmental policies, and international trade agreements, would pose a substantial challenge to their vision of **representative government**. From their eighteenth-century vantage point, the mission was to secure the independence of representatives from undue influence and factional manipulation. The Federalist Papers repeatedly warned of faction and the tyranny of organized interests. If they were to see a political ecosystem in which corporations fund campaigns, sponsor think tanks, and maintain permanent lobbying presences in Washington, they would be concerned that the voice of the ordinary citizen—the yeoman farmer or small merchant of their day—could easily be drowned out.

第三，创始人会考虑到这些经济巨头对公共政策施加的巨大影响。虽然在早期的共和国中也存在特殊利益——从土地贵族到海上商人——但今天的游说网络和其拥有的财力资源远远超出了创始人所能想象的规模。在现代政治格局中，企业的影响帮助塑造了法规、**税法**、环境政策和国际贸易协议，这对于他们的代议制政府构想构成了重大挑战。从他们十八世纪的视角来看，使命是确保代表不受过度影响和派系操控的干扰。联邦党人文献中反复警告派系问题和组织利益的暴政。如果他们看到一个政治生态系统，其中公司资助竞选活动、赞助智库，并在华盛顿维持永久的游说机构，他们会担心普通公民的声音——无论是当时的农民还是小商人——很容易被淹没。

Fourth, the Founders were not economic egalitarians in the modern sense, yet they believed widespread property ownership was essential to maintaining a virtuous and independent citizenry. They favored an economic landscape in which opportunity was relatively open and not foreclosed by entrenched monopoly. While they accepted that some citizens would be wealthier than others, they also recognized the dangers of an economy dominated by narrow interests. Jefferson, for instance, feared the accumulation of wealth and power by a few would threaten the republican character of the nation. Madison warned about the mischiefs of faction, which can arise from economic disparities. Confronted with corporate giants that can influence wages, employment conditions, and local communities across entire regions, they might fear that the delicate balance between economic opportunity and political liberty had shifted. They would wonder whether economic competition is still genuinely open, or whether the barriers to entry and consolidation of market power stifle the possibility of new entrants shaping the economy from below.

Fifth, the global scope of modern corporations would redefine the Founders’ understanding of the American economy. While they understood trade between nations and sought to protect American commerce on the high seas, they nonetheless imagined a republic whose economic heart lay within its own borders. Twenty-first-century corporations transcend national boundaries in production, supply, and sales, leaving regulators at a disadvantage. Questions of citizenship and loyalty become more complex when a firm’s interests may align more closely with global supply chains or multinational investor demands than with the well-being of the American polity. The Founders might well ask: what happens when national wealth and resources serve global capital markets rather than primarily benefiting the nation’s citizens? This tension between national interests and the imperatives of global commerce would challenge the Founders to consider a modern definition of the “common good.”

Sixth, from the perspective of political economy, the Founders would grapple with how to preserve the spirit of a republic in a landscape of corporate oligopoly. They might suggest reforms reminiscent of their own era’s cautious granting of corporate charters—measures to ensure accountability and transparency. Hamilton, who favored a strong federal government to shape a stable financial system, might agree that some federal oversight is crucial, but he would also demand that any oversight not devolve into cronyism or favoritism. Jefferson, more skeptical of consolidated economic power, might push for antitrust action or incentives for small businesses. Madison might emphasize balancing competing interests, ensuring that corporate influence does not eclipse the rights of individual citizens and smaller communities.

Seventh, the Founders might ask how the ideals they fought for—self-governance, checks and balances, the diffusion of power—could be applied to an economy with a handful of corporate players exerting disproportionate control. They might call for ensuring that corporate influence is channeled through transparent institutions subject to the rule of law. They would also likely emphasize the importance of fostering civic virtue within the business community. In their vision, those who amass wealth carry a responsibility to the republic. Today, corporate social responsibility is often discussed as a voluntary measure, a strategic move to enhance brand image. The Founders might seek a firmer moral foundation, perhaps advocating that those who benefit most from the freedom and stability of the American system are duty-bound to contribute to the common good, rather than pursuing profits at the expense of the polity’s health.

Eighth, the Founders would lament if they found that economic might too readily translates into political advantage. In their writings, they repeatedly emphasized that political power should be won through persuasion, debate, and adherence to constitutional principles, not purchased through massive outlays of capital. They would stress that public policy must rest on the consent of the governed—not be unduly molded by the economic levers that a wealthy minority can pull. The challenge for modern America, in their eyes, would be to uphold the core principle that the government’s legitimacy is derived from the people, not from the heights of market power.

Finally, the Founders would consider potential remedies. They might suggest recalibrating the legal status of corporations, renewing the focus on ensuring that these entities serve public ends. They might also recommend stricter antitrust laws to break up monopolistic power and foster competition. Additionally, they would likely encourage greater political engagement by ordinary citizens, improved civic education around economic issues, and a revival of the spirit that the economy should serve the public interest, not the other way around.

In sum, the Founders would find a vastly different economic landscape in modern America than the one they knew. They would marvel at the technological innovations and the prosperity that large-scale enterprises have brought, but they would also be wary of the power these corporations wield within the political system. They would counsel vigilance, reform, and a reassertion of the principle that political power ought never to be merely an extension of economic might. Instead, it should remain grounded in the consent, judgment, and values of a free and equal citizenry.
