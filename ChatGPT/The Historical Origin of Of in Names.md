## 中文版



在我们提到圣方济各时，通常会使用“Saint Francis of Assisi”这一称呼。这个名字中的“of”并非偶然，它承载了丰富的历史背景和时代意义。那么，为什么圣方济各的名字里要加上“of”？它有什么深刻的渊源？在他的时代，使用这种称谓有何特殊含义？而如今，为什么这一形式的名字逐渐被较少使用？本文将从历史、文化和语言角度探讨这一问题。

### 1. “Of”在名字中的历史渊源

在欧洲中世纪，尤其是12世纪至15世纪的时期，“of”这个词在贵族和教士的名字中非常常见。它通常表示“来自某地”或“与某地有关”，相当于现代英语中的“from”或“of”。在圣方济各的时代，意大利的地方性宗教和社会结构非常复杂，各个地方的教士、贵族和市民都会以“of”来标识他们的出生地或来源地，这种做法不仅仅局限于圣方济各一人。

“Saint Francis of Assisi”中的“Assisi”指的是他的出生地——意大利的阿西西镇（Assisi），一个位于翁布里亚地区的小城。按照当时的惯例，圣方济各的名字中的“of Assisi”意指他是“来自阿西西的人”，这不仅标明了他的地理出处，也反映了当时命名习惯的文化背景。

### 2. 中世纪的命名习惯与地方性

中世纪的欧洲，尤其是意大利地区，地方性非常强，各个城市和乡村的身份认同十分突出。当时的命名习惯是通过“of”来表示个体的地方归属。这一现象不仅限于宗教人物，普通民众也常常以“of”来标明自己来自的地方或家族。例如，历史上有许多著名人物如“Giovanni di Medici of Florence”（佛罗伦萨的美第奇家族乔凡尼）等，他们的名字中也会加上“of”来表明家族的起源。

对于圣方济各而言，“of Assisi”不仅是地理上的指代，更具象征意义。在他一生中，阿西西镇深深烙印着他的个人历史和宗教意义，因此“of Assisi”成为了他名字的重要组成部分。圣方济各的生活、信仰和成就都紧密与这个小镇联系在一起，阿西西不仅是他的出生地，更是他人生转折的起点。

### 3. 圣方济各与“of”命名的文化意义

“Saint Francis of Assisi”这一名称，也体现了中世纪基督教文化中地方性与宗教身份的交织。对于中世纪的人们来说，神圣的人物往往被赋予某种地方性的象征意义，强调“某地的人”这一身份，在当时具有很强的宗教文化意涵。

“of Assisi”也暗示了圣方济各对自己出生地的特殊情感以及他与这个地方的紧密联系。阿西西不仅是他一生的见证地，也是他创立方济各会的精神发源地。圣方济各的行为和思想深深影响了阿西西的文化与宗教氛围，因此他的名字中的“of Assisi”不仅是地理标记，还是一种精神传承。

### 4. 为什么现在很少使用这种称呼？

随着时代的变迁和语言的演变，现代社会逐渐摒弃了许多中世纪的命名习惯，尤其是在非贵族或非地方性人物的命名上。如今，我们通常会简称“Saint Francis”或“St. Francis”，而不再频繁使用“of Assisi”这一表达方式。这一变化主要源于以下几点原因：

1. **现代语言简化**：现代英语趋向简洁，尤其是在正式和宗教语境中，许多传统的称呼和命名方式被简化或调整，以更适应日常交流。比如，“of Assisi”在现代社会中被认为冗长，且并非每个人都了解阿西西的历史和背景，因此常被省略。
2. **全球化与去地方化**：在全球化的背景下，人们的身份不再仅仅依赖于地方归属，现代社会更加强调个体的全球认同感。圣方济各作为全球知名的宗教人物，许多信徒和关注者并不需要通过“of Assisi”来理解他的身份与意义。
3. **宗教普及化**：圣方济各作为圣人，已经超越了地方性和具体地域的限制，成为全球基督教信仰的象征之一。因此，“Saint Francis”这一称谓足以代表他，而不需要再强调他出生地的“阿西西”身份。

### 结语

“Saint Francis of Assisi”这一名称中的“of”承载了丰富的历史文化和时代背景，体现了中世纪欧洲地方性命名习惯与宗教身份认同的紧密联系。它不仅标明了圣方济各的出生地，也象征着他与阿西西镇之间深厚的情感与精神纽带。随着时代的发展，虽然“of Assisi”这一名称形式逐渐被简化，但它依然是圣方济各历史与身份的象征，提醒我们记住这位伟大的圣人曾经从一个普通的地方走向全球，影响并改变了无数人的生命。

**The Origins and Significance of "Saint Francis of Assisi"**

When we refer to Saint Francis, we typically use the title "Saint Francis of Assisi." The inclusion of "of" in his name is not accidental; it carries significant historical and cultural meaning. Why does Saint Francis's name include "of"? What is the historical context behind this naming practice? And why is this form of naming used less frequently today? In this blog, we will explore the origins of this title, its cultural significance during Saint Francis’s time, and why its use has diminished in modern times.

### 1. The Historical Origin of "Of" in Names

During the Middle Ages, particularly from the 12th to the 15th centuries, it was common for European names to include "of," especially among **nobility and clergy.** The term "of" was used to indicate "from" or "associated with," similar to the modern English usage of "from" or "of." In Saint Francis's time, people would often use "of" to identify their geographical origin or place of association, not just for saints but also for common people, particularly in Italy.

"Saint Francis of Assisi" refers to his birthplace—Assisi, a town in the Umbria region of Italy. At that time, naming conventions often included "of [place]" to indicate where an individual was from, which reflected the strong local identities of the period. For example, Saint Francis's title signifies that he was "from Assisi," marking his connection to his birthplace and emphasizing his identity as a member of that community.

### 2. Naming Conventions in the Middle Ages and Local Identity

During the medieval period, particularly in Italy, there was a strong sense of local identity. People from different cities, towns, or villages were often identified by the place they came from, and the use of "of" in their names was a reflection of this. For example, we also see names like "Giovanni di Medici of Florence" (Giovanni from the Medici family of Florence). This was not limited to saints; it was a widespread practice among both the nobility and the clergy to use "of" to indicate one’s place of origin.

For Saint Francis, "of Assisi" was not merely a geographic marker but also a symbol of his deep connection to his hometown. Assisi was the site of his birth, his religious calling, and the foundation of the Franciscan Order. By using "of Assisi," it reinforced his association with the town, which played such a central role in his spiritual and religious journey.

### 3. Cultural and Religious Significance of "Of Assisi"

The phrase "Saint Francis of Assisi" also highlights the cultural and religious context of the time. During the medieval period, the Catholic Church and local identities were intertwined, and the naming of saints and religious figures often reflected the deep connection between a person's birthplace and their divine calling. For people living in that era, "of Assisi" would have been a crucial part of understanding who Saint Francis was, as it grounded him in a specific location that was rich in spiritual significance.

In addition, Assisi was not just a geographical point; it was a place imbued with deep spiritual meaning. Saint Francis’s teachings, his vow of poverty, and his love for nature all became closely associated with Assisi. Therefore, his name became more than just a simple identifier; it symbolized his spiritual roots and his commitment to a life of humility and service to others.

### 4. Why is This Form of Naming Less Common Today?

As time has passed, the practice of using "of" in names has become less common, especially outside of nobility or religious figures. Today, we typically refer to him simply as "Saint Francis" or "St. Francis," omitting the "of Assisi." This shift can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Simplification of Language**: Modern English tends to favor brevity and simplicity, especially in formal and religious contexts. "Of Assisi" has become redundant for most people, as the name "Saint Francis" alone is enough to identify the saint.
2. **Globalization and the Loss of Local Identity**: In today’s globalized world, personal identities are often not tied to a specific place. The idea of identifying a person by their place of origin has become less relevant. As Saint Francis became a globally recognized religious figure, his local identity, symbolized by "of Assisi," became less necessary to convey his significance.
3. **Religious Universality**: Saint Francis, as a saint, transcends his local origins and has become a universal symbol of humility, peace, and service. In this context, his name has come to represent his broader religious influence, and the geographical reference to Assisi is no longer essential for understanding his global impact.

### Conclusion

The inclusion of "of" in "Saint Francis of Assisi" reflects the historical, cultural, and religious context of the medieval period. During his lifetime, names like "of Assisi" were common, marking a person’s geographic origin and strengthening their local and religious identity. For Saint Francis, this naming convention highlighted his deep ties to Assisi, a place that played a pivotal role in his spiritual and religious mission.

Today, while the form "of Assisi" is rarely used, it remains an important historical marker of his life and legacy. It reflects a time when local identity was a significant aspect of one's public persona. Despite the simplification of his name in modern times, Saint Francis’s association with Assisi endures, symbolizing his humility, his commitment to peace, and his lasting influence on both the Catholic Church and the world.
