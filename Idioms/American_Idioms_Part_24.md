“*Get along with each other*” 这个短语源自日常英语中的 “get along”，意思是与他人相处的状态或程度。短语中的 “*each other*” 强调双向互动。因此，该短语表示个人之间的关系是积极的、和谐的，能够互相合作或交流。

This phrase originates from everyday conversations and communications, particularly in work and business settings.

“切入正题” 或 “谈到具体细节”。

这个短语的确切起源不十分明确，但最普遍的说法是其源自 19 世纪的美国。可能与家具制作有关，当时工人们需要用黄铜钉（brass tacks）确定布料的具体位置，表示必须直面实际问题和重点。它用来表示从讨论的泛泛之事转向真正重要、具体的内容。

## 466. Get down to the nuts and bolts

bolts：螺栓

“深入细节” 或 “开始处理基本细节”。

这个成语来源于机械工程。螺母和螺栓是基本和必要的部件，用于把一台机器的零件固定在一起。因此这个短语被用来表示从总的概念或计划过渡到具体的实施细节。

This idiom originates from mechanical engineering. Nuts and bolts are fundamental and essential components used to hold parts of a machine together. Thus, this phrase is used to indicate transitioning from a general concept or plan to handling the specific practical details.

这个短语起源于 19 世纪美国家喻户晓的俚语，意思是打扰或惹恼某人。以前，妇女发型比较复杂，如果有人过来抓扒或者弄乱她们的头发，就会让人非常恼火。因此，“get in someone’s hair” 这个表达就慢慢地引申成为让人烦恼和生气的行为。

This phrase originated from a 19th-century American colloquialism, meaning to annoy or irritate someone. Historically, women’s hairstyles were often elaborate, and if someone messed with their hair, it could be very frustrating.

“陷入困境” 或 “遇到麻烦”。

这个短语源自航海和游泳的隐喻。在深水中，相较于浅水，情况往往更加危险，尤其对于不擅游泳的人来说。因此，“Get into deep water” 被用来形容一个人遇到了棘手的问题或陷入了复杂的困境。

This phrase originates from the metaphor of sailing and swimming. In deep water, situations are generally more dangerous compared to shallow water, especially for those who are not strong swimmers. Hence, “Get into deep water” is used to describe someone who has encountered a difficult problem or a complicated situation.

This idiom originates from the feeling of having a heavy burden or repressed emotions weighing on one’s chest.

这个短语的起源并不十分清楚，但普遍认为它可能源自于军中的行走训练。如果士兵们在行军时没有步调一致，便会导致队伍的混乱。另一种说法认为它与舞蹈有关，如果舞伴之间的协调不佳，整个舞蹈就会不流畅。因此，这个短语被用来形容在事情刚开始的时候就出现问题或误解。

This phrase’s origin is somewhat unclear, but it is commonly believed to come from military marching drills. If soldiers do not start marching in sync, it leads to confusion. Another theory ties it to dancing, where partners need to coordinate well; otherwise, the dance won’t be smooth.

This phrase originates from medieval times. Knights and nobles would ride tall horses, symbolizing their high status and privilege. Over time, the phrase evolved to mean urging someone to drop their arrogance and superiority, and to adopt a more humble attitude instead of looking down on others.

## 478. Get something for peanuts

“以极低的价格获得某物” 或 “贱价买到某物”。
