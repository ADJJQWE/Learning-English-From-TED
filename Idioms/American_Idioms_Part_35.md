## 681. Itchy feet

itchy:  美 [ˈɪtʃi] 发痒的；渴望的；急切的

“渴望旅行” 或 “不安分”。

这个习语起源于人们形容想要四处走动的欲望时用的 body metonymy，即 “脚痒”，意味想要移动或者外出的迫切心情。通常用来描述一种想要离开目前环境，开始新的冒险的强烈渴望。metonymy: 美 [məˈtɑːnəmi]  换喻；转喻（一种修辞手法，通过某物的名称来指代与之相关联的事物）

This idiom originates from a body metonymy used to describe the desire to move around, literally translating to “itchy feet.” It signifies a strong urge to leave one’s current environment and embark on new adventures.

ivory:  美 [ˈaɪv(ə)ri] 象牙；牙；

“象牙塔”。这个短语常用来形容与世隔绝、不接地气或者过于理想化的学术或知识分子的世界。

这个成语源于 19 世纪法国诗人夏尔·奥古斯丁·圣博夫（Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve）对《雅歌》中的一句话的抱怨。而后，这个词汇逐渐演变为描述那些远离现实、不受世俗困扰的人和环境。用来描述那些在象牙塔中生活的人，这些人通常是思想家、学者或艺术家，他们沉浸在自己的创作或学术世界中，而对现实中的实际问题漠不关心或不了解。

The term "ivory tower" is often used to describe an isolated, disconnected, or overly idealistic academic or intellectual world.

This phrase originates from a 19th-century complaint by French poet Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve about a line in the "Song of Solomon." Over time, it evolved to depict people and environments removed from reality and everyday concerns. It typically refers to thinkers, scholars, or artists who are deeply immersed in their own creative or academic pursuits, often to the point of being unaware or indifferent to real-world issues.

这个短语 “*Jaywalking*” 起源于 20 世纪初，最初 “*Jay*” 是一个俚语，指的是乡下人，不懂城市规则的人。汽车普及后，行人不遵守交通规则在马路上乱穿，常常会引起交通事故，因此，这个词就被用来描述行人不遵守交通规则横穿马路的行为。

The phrase “*Jaywalking*” originated in the early 20th century. Originally, “*Jay*” was a slang term for a country person who was unfamiliar with city ways. With the advent of automobiles, when pedestrians crossed streets carelessly, it frequently led to traffic accidents, hence the term started being used to describe pedestrians’ non-compliance with traffic rules.

The phrase originates from 19th-century American slang. The term “*joshing*” itself evolved from the name Josh, which was often used to refer to someone who enjoys making jokes. Over time, “*joshing*” became a fixed expression to signify light-hearted joking or teasing.
