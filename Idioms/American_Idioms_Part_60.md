The phrase’s origin can be traced back to the 18th century, introduced by American statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin in his essay “*Advice to a Young Tradesman*”.

This phrase originates from early 19th-century Britain. At that time, “*carpet*” referred to the carpeted office of a high-ranking official. When an employee was called to the superior’s carpeted office, it usually meant they were about to be reprimanded or punished.
