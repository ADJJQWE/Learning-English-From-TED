原文：

The second birthday of ChatGPT was only a little over a month ago, and now we have transitioned into the next paradigm of models that can do complex reasoning. New years get people in a reflective mood, and I wanted to share some personal thoughts about how it has gone so far, and some of the things I’ve learned along the way.

学习：

>这里的 **"reflective mood"** 是指一种 **“沉思的情绪”或“反思的心情”**，通常用来描述人们在某个时刻停下来回顾过去、思考经历和教训的状态。

>
>在文中，**"New years get people in a reflective mood"** 表达的是新年常常让人产生**回顾与反思**的情感倾向。新年作为一个时间节点，人们往往会总结过去的成就和不足，同时展望未来的目标和计划。
>
>类似用法示例：
>
>1. **"After the trip, I was in a reflective mood, thinking about all the memories we made."**

>   他安静地坐在窗边，沉思着下一步该怎么走。



原文：

As we get closer to AGI, it feels like an important time to look at the progress of our company. There is still so much to understand, still so much we don’t know, and it’s still so early. But we know a lot more than we did when we started.



We started OpenAI almost nine years ago because we believed that AGI was possible, and that it could be the most **impactful** technology in human history. We wanted to figure out how to build it and make it broadly beneficial; we were excited to try to **make our mark** on history. Our ambitions were extraordinarily high and so was our belief that the work might benefit society in an equally extraordinary way.

>
>- "The invention of the internet was one of the most impactful developments of the 20th century."
>  互联网的发明是20世纪最具深远影响的发展之一。
>- "Her speech was impactful, leaving the audience inspired and motivated."
>  她的演讲影响深远，激励和鼓舞了观众。
>  文中用法：**创始人认为AGI将成为人类历史上最具深远影响的技术之一，能够从根本上改变社会。**





>**Make our mark**
>意思：**“留下印记”或“产生影响”**，指通过某种成就或贡献在历史或社会中留下重要影响。
>例句：

>  文中用法：**创始人希望通过创造AGI在历史上留下深远的影响，并对社会产生积极的贡献。**



原文：

At the time, very few people cared, and if they did, it was mostly because they thought we had no chance of success.



In 2022, OpenAI was a quiet research lab working on something temporarily called “Chat With GPT-3.5”. (We are much better at research than we are at naming things.) We had been watching people use the **playground feature** of our API and knew that developers were really enjoying talking to the model. We thought building a demo around that experience would show people something important about the future and help us make our models better and safer.

We ended up **mercifully** calling it ChatGPT instead, and launched it on November 30th of 2022.

学习

>
>
>**Playground feature**
>意思：**“测试平台功能”**，指用户可以在API的交互式环境中测试和体验模型的功能，进行对话或实验。
>例句：
>
>- "Developers used the playground feature to test the AI's responses before integrating it into their applications."
>  开发者使用测试平台功能来测试AI的回复，然后将其集成到应用程序中。
>- "The playground feature allows for easy experimentation with different prompts and model settings."
>  测试平台功能便于尝试不同的提示词和模型设置。
>  文中用法：**OpenAI观察到开发者喜欢通过API的测试平台功能与模型交互，发现这种体验非常受欢迎。**





>
>
>**Mercifully**
>意思：**“幸运地”或“令人宽慰地”**，通常表示某种结果让人感到安心或避免了更糟糕的情况。
>例句：
>
>- "Mercifully, the storm ended before causing serious damage."
>  幸运的是，暴风雨在造成严重损害之前就结束了。
>- "The movie was mercifully short, sparing the audience from a tedious experience."
>  这部电影幸运地很短，让观众避免了冗长乏味的体验。
>  文中用法：**OpenAI感到庆幸最终将产品命名为ChatGPT，而不是继续使用临时名称“Chat With GPT-3.5”。**



原文：

We always knew, abstractly, that at some point we would hit a tipping point and the AI revolution would get kicked off. But we didn’t know what the moment would be. To our surprise, it turned out to be this.

The launch of ChatGPT kicked off a growth curve like nothing we have ever seen—in our company, our industry, and the world broadly. We are finally seeing some of the massive **upside** we have always hoped for from AI, and we can see how much more will come soon.

>
>
>**Upside**
>意思：**“潜在好处”或“积极的一面”**，通常指某事可能带来的收益或有利的结果。
>例句：

>  尽管存在风险，该项目具有巨大的潜在收益。
>  文中用法：**OpenAI认为ChatGPT的推出展示了人工智能带来的巨大潜在好处，并预见未来会有更多积极的成果。**

原文：

It hasn’t been easy. The road hasn’t been smooth and the right choices haven’t been obvious.

In the last two years, we had to build an entire company, almost from scratch, around this new technology. There is no way to train people for this except by doing it, and when the technology category is completely new, there is no one at all who can tell you exactly how it should be done.



Building up a company at such high **velocity** with so little training is a messy process. It’s often two steps forward, one step back (and sometimes, one step forward and two steps back). Mistakes get corrected as you go along, but there aren’t really any handbooks or **guideposts** when you’re doing original work. Moving at speed in **uncharted waters** is an incredible experience, but it is also immensely stressful for all the players. Conflicts and misunderstanding abound.



学习

>
>
>**Velocity**
>意思：**“速度”或“快速发展”**，在这里指公司快速成长和推进的节奏。
>例句：
>
>- "The startup grew at an incredible velocity, expanding to new markets within months."
>  这家初创公司以惊人的速度发展，在几个月内扩展到新市场。
>- "High velocity in decision-making often leads to innovation but also increases the risk of errors."
>  决策的高速推进常常带来创新，但也增加了出错的风险。
>  文中用法：描述公司在缺乏充分培训的情况下，以极快的速度发展和推进，伴随着混乱和挑战。

handbook：手册

guidepost：路标；指示牌；指路标志；导向标

>
>
>**Guideposts**
>意思：**“指引”或“指导标志”**，比喻在未知或复杂情况下提供方向和建议的标准或原则。
>例句：
>
>- "Without clear guideposts, navigating through a new business venture can be overwhelming."
>  如果没有明确的指导原则，开创新的商业项目可能会令人不知所措。
>- "Historical precedents often serve as guideposts for modern policy decisions."
>  历史先例常常成为现代政策决策的指导标志。
>  文中用法：表示在进行前所未有的创新工作时，缺乏可供参考的指导标准或经验。

uncharted waters：未知水域          

>
>
>**Uncharted waters**
>意思：**“未知领域”或“未曾涉足的领域”**，比喻前所未有或缺乏经验的情况，带有探索和冒险的意味。
>例句：
>
>- "Starting a company in a brand-new industry is like sailing into uncharted waters."
>  在全新的行业创办公司就像驶入未知水域。
>- "AI development pushes us into uncharted waters where ethical and safety challenges abound."
>  人工智能的发展将我们推向充满道德和安全挑战的未知领域。
>  文中用法：比喻公司在技术创新和快速发展过程中进入没有先例或经验可以依靠的新领域，既充满机遇也伴随压力和风险。

at speed：快速地；高速地；迅速地；全速地          

原文：

These years have been the most rewarding, fun, best, interesting, exhausting, stressful, and—particularly for the last two—unpleasant years of my life so far. The overwhelming feeling is gratitude; I know that someday I’ll be retired at our **ranch** watching the plants grow, a little bored, and will think back at how cool it was that I got to do the work I dreamed of since I was a little kid. I try to remember that **on any given** Friday, when seven things go badly wrong by 1 pm.

学习：

>
>
>**Ranch**
>意思：**“牧场”或“农场”**，这里指作者未来退休后休息和放松的乡村住所，象征一种平静、悠闲的生活方式。
>例句：
>
>- "They bought a ranch in Texas to escape the fast-paced city life."
>  他们在德克萨斯州买了一个牧场，以远离快节奏的城市生活。
>- "After years of hard work, he retired to a quiet ranch in the countryside."
>  多年辛勤工作后，他退休到乡村的一个安静牧场生活。
>  文中用法：描绘作者退休后生活的理想场景，与当前忙碌、压力重重的生活形成对比，反映对未来简单生活的向往。



>
>
>**On any given**

>- "On any given weekend, the park is filled with families enjoying picnics."
>  在任何一个周末，公园里都挤满了享受野餐的家庭。
>  文中用法：强调作者的工作日常充满压力和突发状况，尤其是在周五下午可能会发生许多问题，反映忙碌和混乱的现实情况。



原文：

A little over a year ago, on one particular Friday, the main thing that had gone wrong that day was that I got fired by surprise on a video call, and then right after we hung up the board published a blog post about it. I was in a hotel room in Las Vegas. It felt, to a degree that is almost impossible to explain, like a dream gone wrong.

学习：

hung up ：挂断电话



原文：

Getting fired in public with no warning kicked off a really crazy few hours, and a pretty crazy few days. The “fog of war” was the strangest part. None of us were able to get satisfactory answers about what had happened, or why. 

学习：

fog of war：战争迷雾

原文：

The whole event was, in my opinion, a big failure of governance by well-meaning people, myself included. Looking back, I certainly wish I had done things differently, and I’d like to believe I’m a better, more thoughtful leader today than I was a year ago.

学习：

well-meaning：善意；好心的



原文：

I also learned the importance of a board with diverse viewpoints and broad experience in managing a complex set of challenges. Good governance requires a lot of trust and credibility. I appreciate the way so many people worked together to build a stronger system of governance for OpenAI that enables us to pursue our mission of ensuring that AGI benefits all of humanity.



My biggest takeaway is how much I have to be thankful for and how many people I owe gratitude towards: to everyone who works at OpenAI and has chosen to spend their time and effort going after this dream, to friends who helped us get through the crisis moments, to our partners and customers who supported us and entrusted us to enable their success, and to the people in my life who showed me how much they cared.

学习：

entrusted：委托；（entrust的过去分词）

原文：

We all got back to the work in a more cohesive and positive way and I’m very proud of our focus since then. We have done what is easily some of our best research ever. We grew from about 100 million weekly active users to more than 300 million. Most of all, we have continued to put technology out into the world that people genuinely seem to love and that solves real problems.



原文：

Nine years ago, we really had no idea what we were eventually going to become; even now, we only sort of know. AI development has taken many twists and turns and we expect more in the future.



Some of the twists have been joyful; some have been hard. It’s been fun watching a steady stream of research miracles occur, and a lot of naysayers have become true believers. We’ve also seen some colleagues **split off** and become competitors. Teams tend to **turn over** as they scale, and OpenAI scales really fast. I think some of this is unavoidable—startups usually see a lot of **turnover** at each new major level of scale, and at OpenAI numbers go up by orders of magnitude every few months. The last two years have been like a decade at a normal company. When any company grows and evolves so fast, interests naturally diverge. And when any company in an important industry is in the lead, lots of people attack it for all sorts of reasons, especially when they are trying to compete with it.

学习：

>
>
>**Split off**
>意思：**“分裂”或“分道扬镳”**，指团队中的一些人离开公司，通常是去创建新的公司或成为竞争对手。
>例句：
>
>- "A group of engineers decided to split off and form their own startup."
>  一群工程师决定分道扬镳，成立自己的初创公司。
>- "The research team split off to pursue independent projects."
>  研究团队分开，去开展各自独立的项目。
>  文中用法：描述OpenAI的一些前员工离开公司后成为竞争者的情况，反映技术领域常见的人才流动现象。



>
>
>**Turn over**
>意思：**“更替”或“更换”**，通常指员工的流动率或团队成员的变化。
>例句：
>
>- "The company experienced a high turnover rate last year."
>  该公司去年经历了较高的员工流动率。
>- "As the startup grew, its management team turned over several times."
>  随着初创公司发展壮大，管理团队经历了几次更替。
>  文中用法：强调OpenAI在快速扩张过程中团队不断变化的现实，反映出高速增长带来的挑战和适应需求。



>**Turnover**
>意思：**“人员流动”或“更替率”**，特指公司员工离职和补充的频率。
>例句：
>
>- "High employee turnover can disrupt productivity and morale."
>  高员工流动率可能会影响生产力和士气。
>- "Startups often face significant turnover as they scale."
>  初创公司在扩张过程中通常会面临较大的人员流动。
>  文中用法：进一步说明OpenAI随着规模迅速扩大而经历的员工流动现象，强调高速成长伴随的人员更替不可避免。

原文：



Our vision won’t change; our tactics will continue to evolve. For example, when we started we had no idea we would have to build a product company; we thought we were just going to do great research. We also had no idea we would need such a crazy amount of capital. There are new things we have to go build now that we didn’t understand a few years ago, and there will be new things in the future we can barely imagine now. 





We are proud of our track-record on research and deployment so far, and are committed to continuing to advance our thinking on safety and benefits sharing. We continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer. We believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications.

学习：

>
>
>**Track-record**
>意思：**“记录”或“业绩记录”**，通常指一个人在某个领域的过往表现或成就，强调可靠性或历史表现。
>例句：
>
>- "The company has a strong track-record of innovation and success."
>  这家公司在创新和成功方面有着良好的记录。
>- "Her track-record in managing large projects made her the ideal candidate for the position."
>  她在管理大型项目方面的优秀记录使她成为该职位的理想人选。
>  文中用法：指OpenAI在研究和技术部署方面的优秀表现和历史成就，强调他们在人工智能领域已经取得的成果和经验。



原文：

We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes.



We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. We love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future. With superintelligence, we can do anything else. Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.



This sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. That’s alright—we’ve been there before and we’re OK with being there again. We’re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and **empowerment**, is so important. Given the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company.

How lucky and **humbling** it is to be able to play a role in this work.

>例句：
>
>- "Education is a key tool for the empowerment of women."
>  教育是女性赋权的重要工具。
>- "The new policy focuses on the empowerment of employees to make decisions independently."
>  新政策强调赋予员工独立决策的权力。
>  文中用法：指OpenAI希望通过技术赋予人们力量和能力，使他们能够更好地利用人工智能来提高效率和改善生活。

There were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work to help OpenAI, and me personally, during those few days, but two people **stood out** from all others.

Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and **beyond the call of duty** that I’m not even sure how to describe it. I’ve of course heard stories about Ron’s ability and **tenaciousness** for years and I’ve spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice.

>
>
>**Beyond the call of duty**
>意思：**“超越职责范围”或“尽职尽责之外”**，指某人付出的努力远远超出了他或她被期望做的事情。

But there’s nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do. I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done.

学习：

foxhole：散兵坑；掩体坑



Although they worked unbelievably hard, they stayed calm and had clear strategic thought and great advice throughout. They stopped me from making several mistakes and made none themselves. They used their vast networks for everything needed and were able to navigate many complex situations. And I’m sure they did a lot of things I don’t know about.

What I will remember most, though, is their care, compassion, and support.



I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did. But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do. They are different and both fully deserve their genuinely unique reputations, but they are similar in their remarkable ability to move mountains and help, and in their unwavering commitment in times of need. The tech industry is far better off for having both of them in it.

学习：
unwavering：坚定的；不动摇的；稳定的；



There are others like them; it is an amazingly special thing about our industry and does much more to make it all work than people realize. I look forward to paying it forward.

On a more personal note, thanks especially to Ollie for his support that weekend and always; he is incredible in every way and no one could ask for a better partner.



>**Pay it forward**
>意思：**“将善意传递下去”**，指某人受到了帮助或善意后，不是直接回报给帮助他的人，而是将这种善意传递给其他人，以形成一个良性循环。
>
>例句：
>
>- "A stranger paid for my coffee, so I decided to pay it forward by helping someone in need."
>  一个陌生人帮我买了咖啡，所以我决定将这份善意传递下去，帮助有需要的人。
>- "She received a scholarship in college and later paid it forward by funding scholarships for other students."
>  她大学时获得奖学金，后来通过资助其他学生奖学金来传递这份善意。
>
>**文中用法**：作者表达了希望将自己从他人那里得到的帮助和支持传递给未来需要帮助的人，从而延续这种善意和互助精神。
