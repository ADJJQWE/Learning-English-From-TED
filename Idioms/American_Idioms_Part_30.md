“他是有其父必有其子” 或 “他特别像他父亲”。

This idiom originates from the woodworking analogy. When you chip off a piece of wood from a larger block, the smaller chip retains the same grain and characteristics as the larger block. Accordingly, when someone (*typically a son*) is very similar to their father, this expression is used.

## 590. He’s not playing with a full deck

deck：一副纸牌；

“他不太正常” 或 “他精神有问题”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到纸牌游戏。如果有人 “没有用全副牌” 玩游戏，那么他明显缺少一些至关重要的牌，使得他无法正常进行游戏。这引申为一个人在行为或思维上缺少一些重要的元素，导致他的行动或思维显得异常或不合逻辑。

This phrase originates from card games. If someone is “not playing with a full deck,” it means they are missing some crucial cards that would make it impossible to play the game properly. This metaphorically extends to mean that a person is lacking something important in their behavior or thinking, making their actions or thoughts seem abnormal or illogical.

- After hearing his bizarre theory, I started to think *he’s not playing with a full deck*.听了他那奇怪的理论后，我开始认为他精神有问题。

## 591. He’s off his rocker

“他疯了” 或 “他不正常”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到 19 世纪。原本，“*rocker*” 是指摇椅，而 “off his rocker” 形象地表示一个人从摇椅上掉下来了，暗喻他精神失常或行为异常。加入幽默或俏皮的成分，这个短语常用于非正式场合，表达某人行为不合常理或显得怪异。

This phrase traces back to the 19th century. Originally, “*rocker*” referred to a rocking chair, and “*off his rocker*” figuratively meant that someone had fallen off their rocking chair, implying they were mentally unstable or behaving unusually. With a touch of humor or playfulness, this phrase is often used in informal settings to describe someone acting in a strange or irrational manner.

## 592. Head and shoulders above

“遥遥领先” 或 “大大优于”。

这个短语源于物理高度的比较：如果一个人 “*head and shoulders above*” 另一个人，那么他们的头和肩膀都高于对方，这表明他们比对方高出一截。这个比喻被用来形容人在某些方面的明显优势和超过别人之处。

The idiom originates from a physical height comparison: if someone is “*head and shoulders above*” another person, their head and shoulders are higher than the other’s, indicating they are taller. This metaphor is used to describe someone’s significant advantage and superiority in certain areas.

honcho：英 [ˈhɒn(t)ʃəʊ] 领导；负责人；老板；主管

“头头” 或 “大佬”。

这个短语源自西班牙语单词 “*jefe*”，在日语中被转译为 “班长” 或 “酋长”，意思是领袖或首领。随着时间的推移，这个短语被引入英语并且逐渐演变成 “head honcho”，用来指代某个组织或团体中的最高领导人或最重要的人物。这个短语常用于非正式场合，具有一种轻松、玩笑的语气。

This phrase originates from the Spanish word “jefe,” which was transliterated into Japanese as “班長” or “酋長,” meaning leader or chief. Over time, this term was adopted into English and gradually evolved into “head honcho,” used to refer to the highest leader or the most important person in an organization or group. The phrase is commonly used in informal settings, often carrying a light-hearted or humorous tone.

## 594. Head in the clouds

## 595. Head over heels

Originally, this phrase was used to describe someone falling or tumbling in a topsy-turvy manner.
