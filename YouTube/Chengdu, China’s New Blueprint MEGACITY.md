## Summary

Summary of the Script

Paragraph 1:

Chengdu, the largest metropolis in Southwest China, is known as the country’s greenest big city. With a population nearing 21 million, it exemplifies Beijing's efforts to modernize the interior regions and serves as a key part of an emerging mega-region. Surrounded by scenic mountains and known for its agricultural abundance and spicy cuisine, Chengdu has a rich history dating back over 3,000 years. Despite facing severe challenges such as a Mongol invasion in the 1500s, Chengdu rebounded due to its fertile land, attracting millions of immigrants and developing into a major city. It played a crucial role during the Chinese Civil War in 1949, becoming the last stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek's forces. Post-war, Chengdu attracted talent that established many of its enduring industries and institutions.

Paragraph 2:

Chengdu benefited significantly from Beijing’s “Open Up The West Program” launched in 2000, aimed at spreading prosperity to the western regions. This led to a population boom and significant urban development, including the construction of numerous high-rises and extensive green spaces, earning it the designation of China’s Park City Demonstration Area. Efforts have been made to create a more livable city with parks, paths, and athletic facilities, incorporating ecological development to address challenges. Chengdu plans to establish the world’s largest network of continuous paths by 2050, enhancing its urban environment. Despite some setbacks, such as the corruption scandal involving billionaire Deng Hong’s excessive New Century Global Center, Chengdu’s growth continues to reflect China’s varied visions of prosperity.

Paragraph 3:

China’s broader strategy of integrating population centers has also impacted Chengdu, connecting it with other major cities through extensive infrastructure projects like highways, airports, and high-speed rail. The goal is to unite Chengdu with Chongqing, transforming the region into a mega-region. However, rapid growth is straining natural resources, particularly the overreliance on hydroelectric power, which was highlighted by a recent drought-induced power crisis. To sustain its development, Chengdu needs to diversify its energy sources to prevent future blackouts. The city invites international visitors to experience its famous pandas and numerous parks, hoping they leave with innovative ideas to take back to their own countries.

## Transcript

Southwest China’s largest metropolis is 
the country’s greenest big city. With a  

population of nearly 21 million, it exemplifies 
Beijing’s quest to modernize the country’s vast  

interior and is the lynchpin of an emerging 
mega-region. This is Chengdu, the park city.

Scenic mountains ring the fertile basin 
of Sichuan province, a land known for its  

agricultural abundance and famous cuisine 
of chili-infused sauces and spicy hot pot.  

Its capital has been continuously 
inhabited for more than 3,000 years,  

the only major city in China to have an unchanged 
name and location throughout the imperial,  

republican, and communist eras–a history 
that remains remarkably well preserved.

In the second century BC, Chengdu was one of 
Earth’s largest civilizations, with 350,000  

inhabitants. In the 11th century, the world’s 
first widely used paper money was created here.  

Unfortunately, things turned bleak in the 
1500s when its residents were nearly all  

destroyed by a Mongol 
invasion. For decades afterward,  

Chengdu remained so sparsely populated 
that wild tigers freely roamed its streets.  

But Sichuan was far too fertile a land 
to remain without a major city for long,  

and soon developments in farming and new trading 
opportunities with the western hemisphere drew  

millions of immigrants from provinces near and 
far to cultivate its new cash crop: tobacco.

During the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Chengdu 
was the last stronghold in the country for the  

forces of Chiang Kai-shek’s Republic of 
China before their evacuation to Taiwan.  

In spite of its short-lived status as the capital, 
the city attracted loyal business people, workers,  

and academics–an influx of talent that founded 
many of the industries and institutions that  

continue to make Chengdu the premiere cultural 
and economic center of Southwest China.

In the year 2000, Beijing launched the “Open 
Up The West Program” to encourage immigration  

from its wealthy coastal regions and spread 
prosperity to its 12 poorest areas in the  

west. As an established metropolis, Chengdu 
has been a major winner under the policy.  

Its population has doubled over the last 25 years 
while becoming one of China’s most dynamic cities.  

Between 2010 and 2022 105 highrises over 100 
meters were completed, catapulting it to 12th  

on the list of the world’s tallest metropolises. 
But high-density construction is happening all  

across China. What’s special about Chengdu is the 
amount of land local officials have set aside for  

parks, paths, and athletic facilities, an 
effort to make it as livable as possible.

President Xi has officially designated 
it China’s Park City Demonstration Area.  

Municipal leaders even brought in experts 
from the United Nations to better understand  

how ecological development can solve some 
of Chengdu’s most pressing challenges.  

One ultimate goal is to create the 
world’s largest continuous network of  

paths by 2050 by reserving 500 meters on 
either side of its largest ring highway,  

a project that will eventually produce 
188 square kilometers of parks.

Instead of allowing vehicles to dominate,  

whenever land was cleared for a new highway or 
overpass, a little extra space was set aside  

for parks and paths, making it easier, 
more enjoyable, and safer to bike or walk.  

They’ve also covered much of the 
concrete supporting their transportation  

infrastructure in ivy; designed more appealing 
bridges; and cleaned up their waterways.

But Chengdu hasn't gotten everything 
right. A downside to China’s build-first  

ask-questions-later approach is that some 
businesspeople completely lose their minds  

to greed. Chengdu may be home to the 
worst example of excess in the world:  

billionaire Deng Hong’s 18 million square 
foot New Century Global Center, the largest  

building by floor area in human history. It 
has two malls, a waterpark with a 150-meter  

horizon simulating screen;  plus many offices,  

conference rooms, a university complex, an olympic-size skating rink, Imax cinemas, a Mediterranean village, and a 1,000-room hotel.

On the eve of its grand opening event in 
2013, Deng was arrested on corruption charges  

in an investigation that also ensnared 50 local 
government officials. How such a grossly excessive  

building rose in a city that a decade later is 
being hailed as China’s parkland utopia speaks  

to the many competing visions of prosperity 
being pursued across the People’s Republic.

One vision that has been constant is China’s push 
to connect its many population centers–to make  

travel between them more efficient and supply 
chains more integrated. First, it happened all  

along the coast: most notably by blending the 
national capital with Tianjin on Bohai Bay;  

by joining the cities surrounding 
Shanghai on the Yangtze River delta;  

and in the south by melting three 
megacities - plus China’s newest addition,  

Hong Kong and its seven million 
citizens - into one megaregion.  

Simultaneously, it undertook a nationwide airport, 
highway, and high-speed rail building boom,  

successfully connecting these regions with every 
other city and town in central and eastern China.

The grand plan now for Chengdu is to unite it with 
the other megacity in the basin, Chongqing. From  

a higher altitude, satellite photos show the land 
between the two cities as rural and undeveloped,  

but as we zoom in and updated images appear, 
highways, tunnels, and more pop up all over,  

including Tianfu airport that was just completed 
in 2021 and is set to become one of China’s  

busiest. There’s already one high-speed rail 
line that makes the 190-mile trip between the  

two cities in about an hour, and a second line is 
under construction that will take even less time.

But the region's growth appears to be hitting 
the limit of what its natural resources can  

support. Its air, hemmed in by mountains is 
full of particulates–a consequence of its many  

machines and cars. The good news is that most 
of these motors will soon be electric. The bad  

news is that 80% of its electricity is supplied by 
dammed rivers–an overreliance on hydroelectricity  

that was exposed last summer when drought and 
scorching temperatures dropped water levels so  

low that Sichuan province’s power output was cut 
in half just as everyone’s air conditioners and  

fridges were kicking on. The crisis resulted 
in officials shutting off power to many homes  

and 16,000 industrial sites–for days at a time, 
including a 10 day work stoppage that cut off  

the supply of parts vital for the manufacture of 
Teslas in Shanghai. With rivers to the west and  

south of the city tapped out, and Chengdu rapidly 
sprawling to the east, officials need to quickly  

diversify the electricity supply sooner rather 
than later. If not prolonged blackouts could hit  

during the first summer that international 
visitors have had to explore the new and  

improved megacity since the pandemic shut all of 
China down to the outside world three years ago.

Indeed, Chengdu hopes you come for its 
famous pandas, stay to enjoy its many parks,  

and leave impressed with many ideas for 
how to improve wherever you come from.

Thanks for watching. Last time I explored Buenos  

Aires and next time I’m profiling 
Manilla, the Philippines megacity.
