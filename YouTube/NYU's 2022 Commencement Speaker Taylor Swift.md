## Summary



In her commencement speech at New York University, Taylor Swift shared several key themes and personal reflections:

1. **Gratitude and Recognition**: Taylor begins by thanking the NYU community and acknowledging the significant influence and support of her family and loved ones. She recognizes the collaborative effort involved in the graduates' journeys, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging those who have helped along the way.

2. **Life Experiences and Lessons**: Taylor reflects on her own life experiences, particularly the unconventional path she took in her career. She humorously mentions her lack of a traditional college experience and the challenges she faced in the music industry. Despite these challenges, she highlights how they shaped her success and personal growth.

3. **Embracing Mistakes and Growth**: Taylor discusses the inevitability of making mistakes and how they can lead to valuable life lessons. She emphasizes that mistakes do not equate to failure but rather opportunities for growth and learning. Her personal anecdotes about public scrutiny and overcoming setbacks illustrate this point.

4. **Living Authentically and Passionately**: Taylor encourages the graduates to live with enthusiasm and not to hide their passions or interests. She advocates for being unashamed of one's efforts and desires, stressing that genuine passion and hard work are more valuable than trying to appear effortlessly cool.

5. **Navigating Life's Uncertainties**: Taylor acknowledges the complexities and uncertainties of life, particularly as the graduates move into the next phases of their lives. She advises them to trust their instincts and be prepared for both successes and failures. Her message is one of resilience and adaptability, encouraging the graduates to embrace both the good and the bad.

6. **Advice on Personal Well-being**: Taylor offers practical advice on managing life's emotional and mental burdens. She talks about the importance of discerning what to hold onto and what to let go of, and learning to live alongside inevitable moments of embarrassment or "cringe."

7. **Empowerment and Independence**: Taylor empowers the graduates by reminding them that their choices and paths are their own. While this autonomy can be daunting, it also provides the freedom to shape their futures according to their own values and aspirations.

Overall, Taylor Swift's speech is a blend of humor, personal storytelling, and motivational advice. She inspires the graduates to embrace their individuality, learn from their mistakes, and approach life with enthusiasm and resilience. The key takeaway is to live authentically, pursue passions without shame, and navigate life's ups and downs with a spirit of perseverance and gratitude.

### Taylor's Speech



Hi, I'm Taylor.

(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

Last time I was in a stadium this size

I was dancing in heels and
wearing a glittery leotard.

(podium members chuckling)
(audience cheering)

This outfit is much more comfortable.

I would like to say a huge thank you

to NYU's Chairman of the Board
of Trustees, Bill Berkeley

and all the trustees and
members of the board.

NYU's President Andrew Hamilton,
Provost Katherine Fleming

and the faculty and alumni here today,

who have made this day possible.

I feel so proud to share this
day with my fellow honorees

Susan Hockfield and Félix Matos Rodríguez,

who humble me with the
ways they improve our world

with their work.

(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

As for me, I'm 90% sure,
the main reason I'm here

is because I have a song called "22."

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

And let me just say, I am elated
to be here with you today,

as we celebrate and graduate

New York University's Class of 2022.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

Not a single one of us here
today has done it alone.

We are each a patchwork quilt
of those who have loved us,

those who have believed in our futures,

those who showed us empathy and kindness

or told us the truth, even
when it wasn't easy to hear.

Those who told us we could do it

when there was absolutely
no proof of that.

Someone read stories to
you and taught you to dream

and offered up some moral
code of right and wrong

for you to try and live by.

Someone, tried their best
to explain every concept

in this insanely complex world,

to the child that was you,

as you asked a bazillion questions,

like how does the moon work

and why can we eat salad, but not grass?

(audience chuckles)

And maybe they didn't do it perfectly,

no one ever can.

Maybe they aren't with us anymore.

In that case, I hope
you'll remember them today.

If they are in this stadium,

I hope you'll find your own
way to express your gratitude

for all the steps and missteps

that have led us to
this common destination.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

I know that words are
supposed to be my thing

but I will never be able to find the words

to thank my mom and
dad, my brother, Austin,

for the sacrifices they made every day,

so I could go from
singing in coffee houses

to standing up here with you all today

because no words would ever be enough.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

To all the incredible parents,
family members, mentors

teachers, allies, friends,
and loved ones here today,

who have supported these students

in their pursuit of
educational enrichment.

Let me say to you now welcome to New York,

it's been waiting for you.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

I'd like to thank NYU for making me

technically, on paper at least, a doctor.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

Not the type of doctor
you would want around

in case of an emergency,

unless your specific emergency

was that you desperately
needed to hear a song

with a catchy hook

and an intensely cathartic bridge section.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

Or if your emergency was
that you needed a person

who can name over 50 breeds
of cats in one minute.

(audience cheering)

I never got to have a normal
college experience per se.

I went to public high
school until 10th grade

and then finished my education,

doing homeschool work on the
floors of airport terminals.

Then I went out on the road for radio tour

which sounds incredibly glamorous,

but in reality it consisted
of a rental car, motels,

and my mom and I,

pretending to have loud
mother-daughter fights

with each other during boarding,

so no one would want the empty
seat between us on Southwest.

(audience chuckles)

As a kid, I always thought
I would go away to college,

imagining the posters I
would hang on the wall

of my freshman dorm.

I even set the ending of my music video

from my song "Love Story" at
my fantasy imaginary college

where I meet a male model,
reading a book on the grass.

And with one single glance

we realized we had been
in love in our past lives

which is exactly what
you guys all experienced

at some point in the
last four years, right?

But I really can't complain

about not having a normal
college experience to you

because you went to NYU
during a global pandemic

being essentially locked into your dorms

and having to do classes over Zoom.

Everyone in college during normal times

stresses about test scores.

But on top of that

you also had to pass like
a thousand COVID tests.

(audience chuckles)

I imagine the idea of a
normal college experience

was all you wanted too.

But in this case, you and I both learned

that you don't always get
all the things in the bag

that you selected from the menu

in the delivery surface that is life.

You get what you get.

And as I would like to
say to you wholeheartedly

you should be very proud of
what you've done with it.

Today, you leave New York University

and then go out into the
world, searching what's next,

and so will I.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

So as a rule, I try not to
give anyone unsolicited advice

unless they ask for it.

I'll go into this more later.

I guess I have been officially
solicited in this situation

to impart whatever wisdom I might have

to tell you things that have
helped me so far in my life.

Please bear in mind

that I in no way feel qualified
to tell you what to do.

You've worked and struggled and sacrificed

and studied and dreamed
your way here today.

And so, you know what you're doing

you'll do things differently

than I did them and for different reasons.

So I won't tell you to what to do

'cause no one likes that.

I will, however, give you
some life hacks, I wish I knew

when I was starting out
my dreams of a career

and navigating life,
love, pressure, choices,

shame, hope, and friendship.

The first of which is, life can be heavy

especially if you try
to carry it all at once.

Part of growing up and moving
into new chapters of your life

is about catch and release.

What I mean by that is,

knowing what things to keep
and what things to release.

You can't carry all things, all grudges

all updates on your ex,

all enviable promotions
your school bully got

at the hedge fund his uncle started.

(audience chuckles)

Decide what is yours to
hold and let the rest go.

Oftentimes, the good things in
your life are lighter anyway,

so there's more room for them.

One toxic relationship

can outweigh so many
wonderful, simple joys.

You get to pick what your
life has time and room for.

Be discerning.

Secondly, learn to live alongside cringe.

(audience cheering)
(audience laughing)

No matter how hard you
try to avoid being cringe,

you will look back on your life
and cringe retrospectively.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime.

Even the term cringe might
someday be deemed cringe.

I promise you're probably doing

or wearing something right now

that you will look back on later

and find revolting and hilarious.

(audience chuckles)

You can't avoid it, so don't try to.

For example I had a phase
where for the entirety of 2012,

I dressed like a 1950's housewife

But you know what? I was having fun.

Trends and phases are fun.

Looking back and laughing is fun.

And while we're talking about
things that make us squirm

but really shouldn't.

I'd like to say I'm a big advocate

for not hiding your enthusiasm for things.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

It seems to me that there is a
false stigma around eagerness

in our culture of unbothered, ambivalence.

This outlook perpetuates the idea

that it's not cool to want it.

That people who don't try

are fundamentally more
chic than people who do.

And I wouldn't know because
I've been a lot of things

but I've never been an expert on chic

but I'm the one who's up here,

so you have to listen
to me when I say this,

never be ashamed of trying.

Effortlessness is a myth.

The people who wanted it the least

were the ones I wanted to date

and be friends with in high school.

The people who want it the most

are the people I now hire
to work for my company.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

I started writing songs when I was 12.

And since then it's been
the compass guiding my life,

and in turn, my life guided my writing

everything I do is just
an extension of my writing

whether it's directing
videos or a short film

creating the visuals for a tour

or standing on a stage performing.

Everything is connected
by my love of the craft

the thrill of working through ideas

and narrowing them down and
polishing it all up in the end,

editing, waking up in
the middle of the night,

throwing out the old idea

because you just thought
of a new or better one

or a plot device that ties
the whole thing together.

There's a reason they call it a hook.

Sometimes a string of
words just ensnares me

and I can't focus on anything

until it's been recorded or written down.

As a songwriter I've never
been able to sit still

or stay in one creative
place for too long.

I've made and released 11 albums

and in the process, I've switched genre

from country to pop,
to alternative to folk.

And this might sound

like a very songwriter-centric
line of discussion,

but in a way I really do
think we are all writers

and most of us write in a different voice

for different situations.

You write differently in
your Instagram stories

than you do your senior thesis.

You send a different type
of email to your boss

than you do your best friend from home.

We are all literary chameleons
and I think it's fascinating.

It's just a continuation of the idea

that we are so many things all the time.

And I know it can be really overwhelming

figuring out who to be and when,

who you are now and how to act

in order to get where you wanna go.

I have some good news.
It's totally up to you.

I have some terrifying news.

It's totally up to you.

I said to you earlier that
I don't ever offer advice

unless someone asked me for it

and now I'll tell you why.

As a person who started
my very public career

at the age of 15, it came with a price

and that price was years
of unsolicited advice.

Being the youngest person in
every room for over a decade

meant that I was constantly
being issued warnings

from older members of the music industry,

media, interviewers, executives

and this advice often presented itself

as thinly veiled warnings.

See, I was a teenager at a time

when our society was absolutely obsessed

with the idea of having perfect
young female role models.

It felt like every interview I did

included slight barbs by the interviewer

about me one day, running off the rails

and that meant a different thing

to every person who said it to me.

So I became a young adult
while being fed the message

that if I didn't make any mistakes,

all the children of America

would grow up to be perfect angels.

However, if I did slip up,

the entire earth would fall off its axis

and it would be entirely my fault

and I would go to pop star
jail forever and ever.

It was all centered around the idea

that mistakes equal failure

and ultimately the loss of any chance

at a happy or rewarding life.

This has not been my experience.

My experience has been that my mistakes

led to the best things in my life

and being embarrassed when you mess up

it's part of the human experience.

Getting back up, dusting yourself off

and seeing who still wants to
hang out with you afterward

and laugh about it, that's a gift.

The times I was told
no or wasn't included,

wasn't chosen, didn't
win, didn't make the cut,

looking back, it really
feels like those moments

were as important if not more crucial

than the moments I was told, yes.

Not being invited

to the parties and
sleepovers in my hometown

made me feel hopelessly lonely,

but because I felt alone,
I would sit in my room

and write the songs

that would get me a ticket somewhere else.

Having label executives
in Nashville tell me

that only 35 year old housewives
listen to country music

and there was no place for a
13 year old on their roster

made me cry in the car on the way home

but then I'd post my songs on
my MySpace and yes, MySpace.

(audience chuckles)

And I would message with
other teenagers like me

who loved country music

but just didn't have anyone
singing from their perspective.

Having journalists write in depth

oftentimes critical pieces
about who they perceive me to be

made me feel like I was living
in some weird simulation

but it also made me look inward

to learn about who I actually am.

Having the world treat my love life

like a spectator sport

in which I lose every single game

was not a great way to date
in my teens and twenties,

but it taught me to protect
my private life fiercely.

Being publicly humiliated over
and over again at a young age

was excruciatingly painful

but it forced me to devalue
the ridiculous notion

of minute by minute,

ever fluctuating social
relevance and likability.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

Getting canceled on the internet
and nearly losing my career

gave me an excellent knowledge
of all the types of wine.

(audience laughing)

I know I sound like a consummate optimist

but I'm really not.

I lose perspective all the time.

Sometimes everything just
feels completely pointless.

I know the pressure of living your life

through the lens of perfectionism

and I know that I'm talking
to a group of perfectionists

because you are here
today, graduating from NYU.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

So this might be hard for you to hear.

In your life, you will
inevitably misspeak,

trust the wrong person,
under react, overreact

hurt the people who didn't deserve it,

overthink, not think
at all, self-sabotage,

create a reality where only
your experience exists,

ruin perfectly good moments
for yourself and others,

deny any wrongdoing, not take
the steps to make it right,

feel very guilty, let the guilt
eat at you, hit rock bottom.

Finally, address the pain you caused,

try to do better next time, rinse, repeat.

(audience chuckles)

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

And I'm not gonna lie,

these mistakes will
cause you to lose things.

I'm trying to tell you that losing things

doesn't just mean losing.

A lot of the time when we lose things,

we gain things too.

Now you leave the structure
and framework of school

and chart your own path.

Every choice you make
leads to the next choice,

which leads to the next

and I know it's hard to
know which path to take.

There will be times in life

where you need to stand up for yourself

times when the right thing

is actually to back down and apologize,

times when the right thing is to fight,

times when the right
thing is to turn and run,

times to hold on with all you have

and times to let go with grace.

Sometimes the right thing to do

is to throw out the old schools of thought

in the name of progress and reform.

Sometimes the right thing
to do is to sit and listen

to the wisdom of those
who have come before us.

How will you know what the right choice is

in these crucial moments?

You won't.

How do I give advice to this many people

about their life choices?

I won't.

The scary news is you're on your own now

but the cool news is,
you're on your own now.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

I leave you with this.

We are led by our gut
instincts, our intuition,

our desires and fears,
our scars and our dreams.

And you will screw it
up sometimes, so will I.

And when I do,

you will most likely read
about it on the internet.

Anyway, hard things will happen to us.

We will recover, we will learn from it.

We will grow more resilient because of it.

And as long as we are fortunate
enough to be breathing

we will breathe in, breathe through,

breathe deep, breathe out.

And I am a doctor now,

so I know how breathing works.

(audience laughing)

(audience applauding)

I hope you know how proud I
am to share this day with you.

We're doing this together.

So let's just keep dancing,
like we're the Class of '22.

(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)
