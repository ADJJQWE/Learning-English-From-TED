This phrase originates from the era of traditional mail, where people would write a few lines to keep in touch with others. Hence, “drop someone a line” originally meant to send a short letter.

This phrase can be traced back to mechanical or military contexts, where it originally referred to testing without adding any actual materials or operating the device in its actual working state, ensuring everything functions correctly. Today, “*dry run*” is widely used in various fields, such as theater, public speaking, and project execution, to denote a practice or test before the official performance.

这个短语来源于海狸（beaver）以其勤奋著称。海狸是非常勤劳的动物，常常花费大量的时间和精力来建造和维护它们的栖息地。因此，表达 “*eager beaver*” 用来形容某个总是非常积极、热心并努力工作的人。

This phrase originates from the beaver, an animal known for its diligence.

“吃得很少” 或 “吃得像鸟一样少”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到人们观察到鸟类吃饭时，尽管它们频繁地进食，但是每次吃的量都很少。因而，“eat like a bird” 这个短语被用来形容那些吃得很少的人，像鸟一样，他们的进食量也很小。

This phrase originates from observations that while birds may eat frequently, they only consume a small amount each time. Therefore, “eat like a bird” is used to describe people who eat very little, similar to birds who also eat in small quantities.

## 373. Eat like a horse

这个短语暗指一个人吃得很多。马的体型较大，进食量自然也大，所以用马来形容人的食量。该表达用来描述某人非常能吃，饭量惊人。

This idiom implies that a person eats a lot. Horses are large animals and naturally have a large appetite, so comparing someone’s eating habits to that of a horse emphasizes their considerable food intake. This expression is used to describe someone with a very large appetite.

“我这顶帽子吃了！” 或 “打赌” 及表示自信。

这个短语源自 19 世纪，最早见于英国作家查尔斯·狄更斯的作品《匹克威克外传》（The Pickwick Papers）。类似表达也见于更早的文献中，通常是表示扬言或赌注，如果某件事情未按照预期发生，那么说出此话的人愿意采取极端行为，如吃掉帽子。在现代，“eat my hat” 仍然用来夸张地表达对某事的极度信心，即某事若不发生，他愿意做某种极其不可能或荒谬的事。

This idiom originates from the 19th century, first appearing in the works of British author Charles Dickens, particularly in “The Pickwick Papers”. Similar expressions have also appeared in earlier literature, usually as a boast or bet, indicating that if something does not happen as predicted, the person uttering the phrase would commit to an extreme action, like eating their hat. In modern times, “*eat my hat*” is still used to dramatically express extreme confidence in something happening.

- If he wins the lottery, I’ll eat my hat.如果他中彩票，我这顶帽子吃了。

“颜面尽失” 或 “出丑”。

这个短语的来源不太明确，但一种说法是它来自于戏剧表演中，当演员表现不佳时，有时会被观众扔鸡蛋表示不满，因而演员的脸上沾满鸡蛋。这就有了 “*egg on your face*” 用以形容某人因做错事或说错话而感到羞愧或尴尬的情况。

This phrase’s origin is somewhat unclear, but one theory is it comes from theatrical performances where poor performances would lead to the audience throwing eggs at the actors, hence the actor’s face would be covered in eggs. Therefore, “*egg on your face*” is used to describe someone feeling embarrassed or foolish due to a mistake they made.

- When the CEO’s prediction about the market was completely wrong, he ended up with *egg on his face*.当首席执行官对市场的预测完全出错时，他颜面尽失。

This phrase originated during Elvis Presley’s concerts. To prevent the audience from lingering after the performance, the announcer would say “*Elvis has left the building*” to confirm that the concert was truly over and the singer had left the venue. Nowadays, the phrase is widely used to signify that an event, activity, or process has concluded.
