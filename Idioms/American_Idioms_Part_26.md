## 501. Give someone a hard time

“给某人找麻烦” 或 “让某人不好过”。

这个短语起源于日常生活中，当一个人使另一个人的生活变得困难或令人不愉快时，就会用到这个表达。它常用于描述一种人为的、故意的对其他人造成压力、不便或烦扰的行为。

This phrase originates from everyday scenarios where one person makes another’s life difficult or unpleasant. It is commonly used to describe a deliberate action that causes stress, inconvenience, or annoyance to another person.

## 502. Give someone a piece of my mind

“严厉斥责某人” 或 “直言不讳地批评某人”。

这个短语可以追溯到 16 世纪，当时 “给某人一块自己的心情” 意味着给他们一种非常直接的个人意见，通常是负面的或愤怒的。在现代英语中，这个短语通常用来描述表达某人对某人行为或态度的强烈不满。

This phrase can be traced back to the 16th century, when “giving someone a piece of one’s mind” meant giving them a very direct personal opinion, often negative or angry. In modern English, this phrase is typically used to describe expressing strong discontent or disapproval toward someone’s behavior or attitude.

## 503. Give someone a song and dance

“编瞎话” 或 “找借口”。

这个习语中的 “*song and dance*” 最早源自美国剧院中的古典讽刺表演，艺术家们通过歌唱和跳舞来夸大或掩饰某些事情。后来，这个短语开始用来形容为某件事情编造不真实且复杂的借口或解释，企图迷惑或误导他人。

This idiom originally comes from classic American theater, where performers would use exaggerated singing and dancing to distract or cover something up. Over time, it began to describe the act of creating elaborate and untruthful excuses or explanations to deceive or mislead someone.

- When asked why he was late, he gave them a *song and dance* about traffic.当被问及为什么迟到时，他编了一堆关于交通的瞎话。

- I don’t want your *song and dance*; just tell me the truth.我不想听你的借口；直接告诉我真相吧。

- She gave the teacher a *song and dance* about why she didn’t do her homework.她向老师编了一堆不做作业的借口。

## 504. Give someone short shrift

shrift：美 [ʃrɪft] 忏悔；赦罪；

“草草了事” 或 “敷衍了事”。

这一短语源于中世纪的法律实践，当罪犯被迅速判决并处决时，他们仅允许简短的忏悔时间（shrift）。现代的用法是指不认真对待某人或某事，不给予足够的关注或时间。

This phrase comes from medieval law practices when criminals were quickly judged and executed, with only a brief time given for confession (*shrift*). In modern use, it means to not take someone or something seriously, giving it little attention or time.

- The manager gave her complaint *short shrift* and moved on to the next task.经理对她的投诉草草了事，然后继续处理下一个任务。

- When the idea was proposed, it was given *short shrift* by the board.当这个想法被提出时，董事会敷衍了事。

## 505. Give someone the benefit of the doubt

“把好处归于未知的一方” 或 “姑且相信某人”。

这个短语起源于司法系统中的无罪推定原则。在没有足够证据证明某人有罪的情况下，司法系统通常会选择相信被告是无辜的。这个短语已经被广泛使用，表示在没有明确证据的情况下，选择相信某人的好意或诚信。

This phrase originates from the legal principle of presumption of innocence, where if there isn’t enough evidence to prove someone’s guilt, the judicial system will choose to believe the person is innocent. This expression has been widely used to indicate that, in the absence of definitive evidence, one chooses to believe someone’s good intentions or honesty.

- I didn’t see who took the money, so I’ll *give him the benefit of the doubt*.我没有看到是谁拿了钱，所以我姑且相信是他。

- She might be late, but I’ll *give her the benefit of the doubt* this time.她可能会迟到，但这次我会姑且相信她。

- Even though the explanation seems odd, I’ll *give you the benefit of the doubt*.尽管这个解释听起来很奇怪，但我姑且相信你。

## 506. Give someone the cold shoulder

“冷落某人” 或 “对某人爱理不理”。

这个短语起源于中世纪，当时如果一位客人在主人的家中受到了冷落，他可能会被提供冷的食物或冷的肩肉（通常是羊肩肉），表示不再受欢迎。这个动作象征了拒绝与疏远。“Give someone the cold shoulder” 已经广泛用于形容冷淡对待或故意忽视某人。

This phrase originated in the Middle Ages when a guest who was not well-received might be given cold food or a cold shoulder of mutton, indicating that they were no longer welcome. This action symbolized rejection and distancing. “*Give someone the cold shoulder*” has become widely used to describe treating someone with indifference or intentionally ignoring them.

- After their argument, she gave him the *cold shoulder* all week.争吵过后，她整整一周都对他冷眼相对。

- I can’t believe he would give me the *cold shoulder* after all we’ve been through.我无法相信在我们经历了这么多之后，他会冷落我。

- If you’re unhappy, don’t just give me the *cold shoulder* — let’s talk about it.如果你不开心，不要只是冷落我 —— 我们谈谈吧。

## 507. Give them the slip

“摆脱他们” 或 “甩开他们”。

这个短语起源于 19 世纪，意指通过巧妙的手段从某个别人不想你离开的场合逃脱。在那时，如果有人用 “给你一张纸条（slip you a note）” 等同于偷偷摸摸给信息，因此 “给他们纸条” 逐渐演变为 “摆脱他们”。

This phrase originated in the 19th century, meaning to escape from a place or situation that others do not want you to leave, often using clever means. During that time, if someone “*slipped you a note*”, it implied secretly providing information, hence “*give them the slip*” evolved to mean escaping or shaking off.

- We had to *give them the slip* to avoid being caught.我们不得不甩开他们以免被抓住。

- She managed to *give the paparazzi the slip*.她成功地甩开了狗仔队。

- The thief *gave the police the slip* and disappeared into the crowd.小偷甩开了警察并消失在人群中。

## 508. Go against the grain

grain：（皮革、木材等的）纹理

“逆势而为” 或 “违反常理”。

这个短语起源于木工加工中的术语。在木工中，沿着木纹切割是最容易和最有效的，而逆着木纹切割（go against the grain）则费力且可能导致木材破裂。因此，这个表达逐渐用来形容做事不顺从常理，或与众不同的方式。

This phrase originates from woodworking terminology. In woodworking, cutting along the grain is the easiest and most effective, while cutting against the grain is laborious and may cause the wood to splinter. Therefore, this expression gradually came to describe doing things in a way that defies convention or is uniquely different.

- He always likes to *go against the grain* and do things differently.他总喜欢逆势而为，用不同的方式做事。

- Her decision to travel alone *goes against the grain* of what her family expects.她独自旅行的决定与家人的期望背道而驰。

- It’s challenging to *go against the grain*, but sometimes it’s necessary for innovation.虽然逆势而为充满挑战，但有时候为了创新这是必要的。

## 509. Go around in circles

“原地打转” 或 “徒劳无功”。

这个短语源自于一种毫无方向感的状态，形象地表示反复进行某种活动却无法得出实际成果。通常用来形容人们在处理问题或任务时，没有找到有效的解决方案，来回反复地做同样的事而没有进展。

This idiom originates from the idea of moving in a circular path without making any real progress, representing repetitive actions without achieving productive results. It is often used to describe situations where people continue doing the same thing without making effective progress in solving a problem or completing a task.

- We’ve been trying to solve this issue for hours, but we’re just *going around in circles*.我们已经试图解决这个问题好几个小时了，但结果只是原地打转。

## 510. Go back to the drawing board

“重新开始” 或 “从头再来”。

这个短语源自于设计和工程领域，通常在图纸绘制不满意或计划未能成功时使用。回到绘图板意味着需要重新规划和设计，以便找到更好的解决方案。在现代社会，这个习语被广泛应用于各种领域，表示某个计划失败，需要从头再来。

This phrase originates from the fields of design and engineering, typically used when a draft or plan is unsatisfactory or unsuccessful. Going back to the drawing board means you need to replan and redesign to find a better solution. In modern society, this idiom is widely applied across various fields to indicate that a failed plan requires a fresh start.

## 511. Go bananas

“发疯” 或 “变得狂热”。

“*Go bananas*” 这个短语来源于 20 世纪中期的美国俚语，常被用来形容某人突然变得非常兴奋、愤怒或是表现出非理性的行为。关于该短语的确切起源有很多说法，但其中一种较为普遍的解释是它与猴子喜欢香蕉有关，因为看到香蕉时猴子显得特别激动和疯狂。

This phrase originated in American slang in the mid-20th century and is often used to describe someone who suddenly becomes extremely excited, angry, or exhibits irrational behavior. There are various explanations for its exact origin, but one common theory is that it is related to the way monkeys act excitedly around bananas.

- The kids went bananas when they heard about the trip to Disneyland.孩子们听到要去迪士尼乐园的消息后变得非常兴奋。

- Her mother went bananas when she saw the mess in the kitchen.她妈妈看到厨房的凌乱后非常生气。

## 512. Go belly up

belly：腹部；肚子

“倒闭” 或 “失败”。

这个短语源自鱼类死亡后会四肢朝天漂浮在水面上的情景，显得它们的肚子 (*belly*) 朝上 (*up*)，因此用于形容企业或项目彻底失败和崩溃。在现代英语中，这个表达通常用于指企业破产或事情彻底失败。

This phrase originates from the imagery of fish turning belly up when they die, floating on the water surface with their bellies facing up, signifying they are dead. Thus, the expression is used to describe a business or project that has completely failed.

“发疯” 或 “变得非常疯狂”。

这个短语源于俚语，它最早出现在 20 世纪 40 年代，意为失去控制或行为异常。虽然 “*bonkers*” 是一个具有滑稽意味的词，但它通常用来描述人们因压力、焦虑或其他原因而变得异常激动或失控。这种表达常用于形容人在某些情境下的情绪失控，既可以是开心过度，也可以是因为愤怒或焦虑。

This phrase originates from slang appearing around the 1940s, meaning to lose control or act unusually. Although “*bonkers*” is a somewhat humorous term, it is typically used to describe someone who becomes excessively agitated or out of control due to stress, anxiety, or other reasons.

## 514. Go cold turkey

“突然完全戒掉” 或 “立即戒断”。

这个短语源自戒毒或戒酒的过程，指不通过渐进的方法，而是突然完全停止使用某种物质。因为身体会立即出现戒断反应，类似于感到冰冷的鸡肉，所以称之为 “go cold turkey”。如今，这个表达被广泛用于描述任何突然停止某种习惯或行为的情景。

This phrase originates from the process of quitting drugs or alcohol, indicating the sudden complete stop of using a substance instead of a gradual reduction.

这个短语的起源可以追溯到航空术语，当飞机被击中或机械故障导致坠毁时，通常会燃烧并坠于地面。在现代使用中，这个短语用来比喻一个计划、项目或任务以极不成功的方式结束。

This phrase originates from aviation terminology, where a plane that gets hit or suffers mechanical failure may burn and crash to the ground. In modern usage, this phrase metaphorically describes a plan, project, or task that ends in a spectacularly unsuccessful manner.

This phrase is a lively expression in English similar to telling someone to “*get lost*” or “mind their own business.” It emerged in the early 20th century, likely as a humorous or sarcastic method to get someone to stop bothering you.

## 518. Go haywire

haywire： 美 [ˈheɪˌwaɪ(ə)r] 失控的；混乱的；

“失控” 或 “乱套”。

“*Go haywire*” 这个短语源自于 19 世纪，当时的农民们使用一种叫做 “干草电线”（haywire）的铁丝将干草捆绑在一起。这些铁丝常常会因为使用频繁而缠绕在一起，成为杂乱无章、难以处理的状态。因此，这个短语后来用以表示某事物变得混乱失控、不再按照正常情况运行。

This idiom originates from the 19th century when farmers used a wire called “*haywire*” to bundle hay. These wires often became tangled and difficult to manage due to frequent use.

## 520. Go off half-cocked

“未做好准备就行动” 或 “鲁莽行事”。

这个短语起源于旧式火枪的发射机制。如果火枪的扳机没有完全扣紧（即 “半扣” 状态），可能会导致意外走火，没有达到预期效果。因而，“Go off half-cocked” 引申为在没有充分准备或考虑的情况下仓促行事、冒失行动。

This idiom originates from the mechanism of old firearms. If the gun’s trigger was not fully cocked (i.e., in a “half-cocked” state), it could misfire or discharge unexpectedly, leading to unintended consequences. Thus, “Go off half-cocked” has come to mean acting hastily or rashly without proper preparation or thought.
