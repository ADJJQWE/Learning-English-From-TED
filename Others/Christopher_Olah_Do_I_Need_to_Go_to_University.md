Instead of asking “Is university good?”, ask “Do I have something more compelling to do?”

Posted on May 30th, 2020

*This essay collects thoughts I've had over several years, and doesn't attempt to address present changes in whether it makes sense to attend university due to COVID.*

I’ve been somewhat successful as a researcher without an undergraduate degree or PhD. As a result, I often have people ask me about whether it’s possible to be successful without going to university, whether they personally should, or whether I can help them persuade their parents. At this point, I've probably received around a hundred emails on this topic. It's still hard to know how to respond.

I’m reluctant to encourage people I don’t know well to take non-traditional paths, because I think they’re riskier and depend a lot on the person. In fact, I suspect that many of the people who write to me would be well served by going to university. At the same time, I think alternative paths can be a great choice for some people -- in some cases, significantly better than going to university.

Unfortunately, society isn’t very well set up to support and validate young people for whom this is the better choice. So, if you’re considering doing such a thing, you not only need to reason about whether it’s a good decision, but may also need to navigate tricky emotional and social challenges.

I suspect that some people who write to me are really looking for validation and support of their preference to not go to university. Unfortunately, I’m not well positioned to give that support, because I don’t know them well.

What I can give, and what this essay aims to do, is to share thoughts on ways to think about the decision, navigating the social and emotional challenges, and resources you may find helpful.

## Ways of Thinking about the Decision

My first suggestion is to compare university to concrete alternatives. Instead of asking “Is university good?”, ask “Do I have something more **compelling** to do?”. Instead of “Should I do a PhD?”, ask “Where can I find the best environment to grow as a researcher?”. And so forth.

>
>In this context, **"compelling"** means **"convincing, attractive, or persuasive"**—something that strongly draws attention, interest, or enthusiasm.
>
>Detailed Explanation:
>
>When the author says **"something more compelling to do"**, they are referring to an **alternative option that is more appealing, meaningful, or beneficial** than going to university. It implies that the alternative should be so strong or attractive that it provides a **clear and persuasive reason** to choose it over university.
>
>Example Sentences:
>
>1. *She received a **compelling** job offer that made her reconsider finishing her degree.*
>    她收到了一个极具吸引力的工作邀请，这让她重新考虑是否要完成学位。
>2. *The documentary provided **compelling** evidence of climate change.*
>    这部纪录片提供了关于气候变化的令人信服的证据。
>3. *He didn’t have a **compelling** argument for quitting his job.*
>    他没有一个令人信服的理由辞职。
>
>Comparison with Similar Words:
>
>- **Attractive**: Focuses on visual or emotional appeal rather than intellectual or logical reasoning.
>- **Persuasive**: Focuses more on influencing opinions or decisions through argument or reasoning.
>- **Convincing**: Highlights logical strength, often used for arguments or evidence rather than actions or choices.
>
>In Context:
>
>The author suggests **reframing the question** from a vague assessment of university's value ("Is university good?") to a **comparison with specific, attractive alternatives** ("Do I have something more compelling to do?"). This approach encourages critical thinking about **better opportunities** instead of viewing the decision in isolation.





Spending a year doing something else is almost always reversible: if you end up wanting to go back to university, it was just a gap year. As a result, the most important question is whether it will be time well spent and that requires you to think about what specifically you’ll be doing.



If your plan is to learn or work on projects independently, it’s worth thinking especially carefully. This can be great -- I did it for three years and grew a lot as a result -- but it can also very easily fail. Some important questions to ask yourself are:

- Do I have things I deeply want to spend a year of my life exploring or working on?
- Do I have a way to support myself that leaves me time and energy to grow?
- Can I really work self-directed for months at a time? Do I have examples of me working hard on a personal project or learning without external structure?
- Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project independently?
- Do I have sources of community, peer support or mentorship for what I want to do?

self-directed：自我指导的；自主的；自我管理的；自我导向的



>如果你的计划是独立学习或从事项目，那就特别值得仔细考虑。这可能很棒——我做了三年，结果成长了很多——但也很容易失败。一些重要的问题需要问自己:
>
>- 我有没有非常想花一年时间去探索或努力的事情？
>- 我是否有办法养活自己，让我有时间和精力成长？
>- 我真的能一次连续几个月独立工作吗？我有没有在个人项目上努力工作或者在没有外部结构的情况下学习的例子？
>- 我是否拥有或者可以学习独立完成这个项目所需的技能？
>- 对于我想做的事情，我有社区、同伴支持或指导的来源吗？





Some of these questions are tempting to just say yes to without engaging: “*Of course* I can work self-directed without structure.” But these are actually difficult things, and switching to having no structure is jumping into the deep end. Many of the people I’ve seen successfully work independently in their late teens / early twenties had a history of independent study or projects before doing so. For example, many Thiel Fellows had either self studied to the point where they were they largely knew the undergraduate curriculum in some topic, or had significant applied expertise in programming.

Doing an internship, residency, or startup can be easier -- at least in some regards -- than working independently. There’s more structure (especially in the first two) and a clearer path to supporting yourself. For these, I would mostly focus on how valuable you think the experience will be. Do you feel like you’ll learn? Does it feel like a good community? Does it feel important? If it feels urgent, is the urgency for good reasons?
