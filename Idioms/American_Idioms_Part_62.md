This phrase originates from late 19th century America and is typically used to express that someone’s expectations or hopes are unrealistic. It is often used to mean that someone is greatly mistaken.

这个短语起源于一种防御和战斗中常见的情境，当你背靠墙时，无退路可走，只能面对眼前的挑战。这意味着处于一个非常困难或危险的境地，似乎没有任何选择或逃脱的可能。通常用于形容处在困境中的人不得不孤注一掷。

This phrase originates from a common defensive and combat situation where, when one’s back is against the wall, there is no retreat and one must face the challenge head-on.

## 1223. To hold out an olive branch

olive：美 [ˈɑːlɪv] 橄榄；橄榄树；油橄榄；

olive branch：橄榄枝

“伸出橄榄枝”，表示意欲和平或示好。

这个短语源自古希腊和圣经的故事。在《圣经》中，诺亚方舟上的鸽子叼着橄榄枝返回，作为洪水结束和平和平恢复的象征。在古希腊文化中，橄榄枝同样象征和平与和解。因此，“hold out an olive branch” 就成为了表达希望停止争斗、达成和平或修复关系的象征性短语。

The phrase comes from ancient Greek and Biblical stories. In the Bible, a dove returns to Noah’s Ark with an olive branch, indicating the end of the flood and the return of peace. In ancient Greek culture, the olive branch similarly symbolized peace and reconciliation. Therefore, “*hold out an olive branch*” has become a figurative expression meaning to seek an end to conflict, to foster peace, or to mend relationships.

- After the heated argument, she decided to *hold out an olive branch* and apologized.在激烈的争吵之后，她决定伸出橄榄枝并道歉。

## 1224. To hold your own

“坚守立场” 或 “自立自强”。

This phrase originates from medieval combat and fencing scenes, where it meant to maintain one’s position and not be defeated. In modern usage, it describes someone who can maintain their position or perform just as well as others in challenging or competitive situations.

This phrase originates from the concept of recognizing someone or something purely by visual appearance, not by knowing them personally or by name. In modern usage, this expression typically describes a situation where one person recognizes another based on having seen them around but doesn’t necessarily know them well.
