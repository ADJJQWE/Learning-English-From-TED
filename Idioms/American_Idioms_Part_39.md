This phrase originates from stage plays or scripts, where actors are required to deliver their lines word-for-word perfectly. Historically, this term was used to imply that actors needed to memorize their lines with complete accuracy to perform the script flawlessly.

这个短语来源于 20 世纪早期的美国，最早出现在一首叫做《The Best in the House is None Too Good for Reilly》的流行歌曲中。随后由于 20 世纪 40 年代的广播节目《The Life of Riley》的流行，进一步巩固了这一表达。节目讲述了一个普通美国人的轻松愉快的生活，因此这个短语开始被用于描述一种无压力、舒适惬意的生活方式。

This idiom originated in early 20th-century America, first appearing in a popular song called “The Best in the House is None Too Good for Reilly.” It was later popularized by a 1940s radio show titled “The Life of Riley,” which depicted the easygoing and comfortable life of an average American. Hence, this phrase came to be used to describe a life free from worry and full of comfort.

这个短语源于宰鸡的过程：当鸡的头被砍掉后，它的身体还会因为神经系统的作用而四处乱跑。这种状态被用来形象地比喻一个人在没有明确方向和目的的情况下惊慌失措地做事。

This phrase originates from the process of slaughtering chickens: when a chicken’s head is cut off, its body can still run around due to the nervous system’s response. This condition is metaphorically used to describe someone acting in a panicked and disorganized manner without clear direction or purpose.

This phrase originates from the reaction of deer when they encounter oncoming headlights at night.

This idiom originates from the image of trying to nail jello to a wall, which is practically impossible because of the jello’s soft and unstable nature. This vivid metaphor effectively conveys the difficulty and futility of the task at hand.

The origin of this phrase is derived from the observation that water droplets quickly slide off a duck’s feathers without soaking them.
