## 541. Good egg

“好人”、“善良的人”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到 20 世纪初，最早出现在英国。它常用于描述一个品行端正、乐于助人的人。相比之下，“bad egg” 则表示一个品行不佳、令人失望的人。因此，“*good egg*” 常常用来称赞那些行为和性格都非常正直友善的人。

The origin of this idiom can be traced back to the early 20th century, first appearing in the UK. It is used to describe someone who is good-natured and helpful.

This phrase is often used to express approval and encouragement towards someone else’s actions, achievements, or decisions. In North America, “Good for you!” is a way to congratulate, commend, or encourage someone, usually employed when the person has achieved something or made a positive choice.

“哇哦，太棒了！” 或 “真是令人兴奋！”

这个短语来源于英语国家儿童经常吃的糖果 “橡皮糖”（gumdrops），而 “*Goody*” 一词则源自 “*good*”，带有兴奋和庆祝意味。它通常用来表达强烈的喜悦和兴奋，类似于中文中的 “太棒了” 或 “好极了”。

This phrase originates from the candy “*gumdrops*” that children often enjoy in English-speaking countries. The word “*Goody*” is derived from “*good*” and conveys excitement and a celebratory tone.

goof：英 [ɡuːf] 犯错；失误；做傻事；闲荡

“偷懒” 或 “磨蹭”。

这个短语起源于美国俚语，最早在 20 世纪初使用。“*Goof*” 表示愚蠢的错误或行为，而 “*off*” 则表示摆脱或离开。因此，“*goof off*” 指的是某人无所事事、浪费时间，通常是在应该做某事的时候。这个短语在非正式场合中较为常用，尤其在谈论工作或学习时形容不认真或不投入。

This phrase originates from American slang, first used in the early 20th century. “*Goof*” means a foolish mistake or behavior, while “*off*” implies getting rid of or quitting. Thus, “*goof off*” refers to someone wasting time or not doing what they should be doing.

scot：税赋；估定的款项；分摊的款项

scot-free：毫发无损地；未受惩罚地；

“未受任何惩罚” 或 “逃脱惩罚”。

这个短语起源于古英语中的 “*scot*”，意为税收或款项。在中世纪，“*scot*” 是另一种税，指的是某种分摊费用。如果某人 “got off scot-free”，意味着他们逃脱了这种税务或责任，最终这一说法演变为逃避任何形式的惩罚或负担。

This idiom originates from the Old English word “scot,” which referred to a tax or payment. In medieval times, “*scot*” was a term used for a kind of tax that indicated some form of share. If someone “got off scot-free,” it meant they avoided this tax or responsibility. Over time, it evolved to mean avoiding any form of punishment or burden.

- He broke the vase but *got off scot-free* because no one saw him.他打碎了花瓶，但因为没有人看到他，所以他逃脱了惩罚。

## 549. Got the third degree

“被严厉盘问” 或 “受到严格的审问”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到十九世纪末。当时，警察用 “三度逼供法”（the third degree）来指严厉的审问或逼供。“第三度” 可能源于共济会等级制度，在共济会里，第三度是一个相当高的等级，代表了严格的考验和衡量。随着时间的推移，这个短语便演变为描述受到严厉盘问的情景。

In origins dating back to the late 19th century, the phrase “the third degree” was associated with a tough level of interrogation or coercion by police. The “*third degree*” might come from the Masonic system of degrees, where the third degree signifies a high level requiring rigorous testing. Over time, the phrase morphed into common usage to describe scenarios where someone is subjected to intense questioning.

- He got the third degree from his parents after coming home late.他回家晚了以后被父母严厉盘问。

hackles：颈背部毛；细长羽毛；针排；颈背部的毛发

“竖起脊毛” 或 “激怒” 。

这个短语源于狗或猫等带有脊毛的动物，当它们受到威胁或感到愤怒时，脊毛会竖起来以示威胁。因此，这个表达用来描述某人因为某件事情而感到愤怒或被激怒。

This phrase originates from animals such as dogs or cats that have hackles (*the hairs on the back of their neck*). When these animals feel threatened or angry, their hackles rise as a sign of aggression. Thus, this expression is used to describe someone who is angry or provoked by something.

This idiom originates from an old metaphor where a drowning person, in a desperate attempt to survive, would grasp at even a straw, having no other options. In modern usage, it describes situations where someone in extreme or desperate circumstances attempts any means they can, even if these means are likely to be ineffective.

graveyard：墓地；公墓；坟场（常在教堂附近）

“夜班” 或 “凌晨班”。

这个短语来源于 19 世纪，用于形容在深夜或者清晨时段工作的班次。因为这个时段往往非常安静、黑暗，与墓地（graveyard）的氛围相似，因此被称为 “墓地班次” 或 “凌晨班”。

This phrase originated in the American railroad industry in the early 20th century.
