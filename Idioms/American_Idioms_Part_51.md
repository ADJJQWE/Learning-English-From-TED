这个短语源自娱乐业，最早用于描述电影导演或剧院导演的职责。他们在场景布置、演员调度以及整体观感上有决定性发言权。在现代，“run the show” 被广泛用于各种场合，尤其是在职场中，意思是某人对项目、团队或事件负有全部责任，并掌控它的每个方面。

This phrase originates from the entertainment industry, originally describing the responsibilities of a movie or theater director who has the decisive say in setting up scenes, managing actors, and the overall presentation.

这个短语的起源可以追溯到工业时代的工厂术语，“run-of-the-mill” 原本是指工厂生产线上所产出的普通产品，不带有任何特殊或高品质的含义。如今，这个短语已经广泛用于描述任何普通、平常或没有什么特别出众之处的人或事。

This phrase originates from industrial factory terminology, where “run-of-the-mill” referred to ordinary products coming off the production line without any special or high-quality distinction.

fumes： 美 [fjuːmz] 烟雾；（强烈而刺激的）气味；烟气；（fume的复数）

“继续运行但已几乎没有能量”；常用于形容人已经疲惫不堪但仍在勉强坚持。

这个短语来源于汽车燃油几乎耗尽但仍继续行驶的情况。汽车燃油快用完时，通常仅靠最后残余的一点燃油（俗称 fumes，意为烟或气），持续运转。借此比喻人们在精力或资源几乎耗尽的情况下，仍然努力工作或继续前行。

The idiom comes from the scenario where a car keeps running while it is almost out of fuel. When a car is low on gas, it often runs on the very last bit of fuel, which is metaphorically called fumes. This compares to people continuing to work or move forward while their energy or resources are nearly depleted.

This idiom originates from nautical terminology, where it refers to a ship sailing as close as possible to the wind direction without losing propulsion. While this method allows the ship to move forward quickly, it also carries a lot of risk.

这个习语起源于《圣经》，在《马太福音》5:13 中，耶稣告诉他的门徒们，“你们是世上的盐”。在这一上下文中，盐既象征着纯洁、保存力量，也代表了那些通过自身美德和诚实来提升整个社会的人。

This idiom originates from the Bible, in Matthew 5:13, where Jesus tells His disciples, “You are the salt of the earth.” In this context, salt symbolized purity and preserving power, representing those who, through their own virtue and honesty, improve society as a whole.

- My grandmother is the *salt of the earth*. She always helps her neighbors and never expects anything in return.我的祖母是社会中最有价值的人。她总是帮助她的邻居，并且从不期望回报。

This phrase originates from boxing matches. When a boxer is on the verge of being knocked out by the opponent, the end-of-round bell rings, allowing the boxer to temporarily escape the dire situation.

## 1008. Saved someone’s skin

“救了某人的命” 或 “让某人免于困境”。

这个短语最早可以追溯到 18 世纪，当时 “皮”（skin）是指整个人。因此，“saved someone’s skin” 意指从危急或困难的情况中拯救某人，使其不受到惩罚或伤害。它通常用在形容某人帮助另一个人避免了严重的麻烦。

This phrase dates back to the 18th century when “*skin*” referred to the entire person. Therefore, “saved someone’s skin” means rescuing someone from a critical or difficult situation, preventing them from punishment or harm.

## 1009. Saving for a rainy day

“未雨绸缪” 或 “储蓄以备不时之需”。

这个短语源自于古老的农民生活，在雨天不适合进行农活，所以需要在好天气的时候储存足够的粮食和物资，确保在无法进行户外活动时也能维持生计。在现代生活中，这个成语用来表达人们在经济上的预备，以避免未来可能出现的困难或紧急情况。

This phrase originates from the old farming life where bad weather, such as a rainy day, would prevent work, requiring the storage of enough food and supplies during good weather to sustain themselves when outdoor activities were impossible.

## 1010. Say uncle

“认输” 或 “投降”。

这个短语的起源并不十分明确，但有一种常见的理论认为，它源自儿童之间的游戏或打闹，当一方被另一方制服时，被迫说 “叔叔”（uncle）来请求对方停止。这个表达方式后来被用在任何逼迫或让步的情况下，意指承认失败或屈服。

This phrase’s exact origin is unclear, but a common theory is that it comes from children’s games or roughhousing, where one child would force another to say “*uncle*” as a way of asking for mercy.

“发表意见” 或 “说出自己的观点”。

This phrase originates from Old English “say one’s piece,” initially referring to someone’s chance to make a statement or express an opinion in formal settings.

这个短语源于《圣经》中旧约的《利未记》16 章，在赎罪日，祭司亚伦要将一只羊放归旷野，象征着赎去以色列人所有罪孽。这个传统行为使 “*scapegoat*” 成为了承担他人罪责或过错的代名词。在现代用法中，它用来描述无辜地被指责或被迫承担责任的人。

This phrase originates from the Bible, specifically the Book of Leviticus 16, where on the Day of Atonement, the priest Aaron would send a goat into the wilderness, symbolically carrying the sins of the Israelites. This ritual act made “*scapegoat*” a term used to refer to someone who is unfairly blamed or forced to take responsibility for the wrongdoing of others.

这个短语的字面意思是 “把某人的裤子吓掉”，实际上是形象地描述某人被深深地吓到的状态，仿佛惊恐之极导致裤子都要掉下来。虽然短语的起源不详，但很可能是因为裤子掉是一种突兀且令人尴尬的情景，所以用来形容特别惊吓场面。

This phrase literally means “scare someone’s pants off,” and it vividly describes someone being extremely frightened, to the point where their pants might fall off. Although the exact origin is unclear, it likely arose from the idea that losing one’s pants is an abrupt and embarrassing situation, hence emphasizing a state of great fear.
