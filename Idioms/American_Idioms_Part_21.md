## 401. Feel/look like death warmed over

“感觉/看起来像被加热的死亡” 或 “打扮得像个鬼”。

这个成语用来形容一个人看起来非常不健康、疲惫或病态。它常用于描述一个人因生病、疲劳或其他原因而看起来或感觉非常糟糕的状况。

This idiom is used to describe someone who looks or feels extremely unwell, tired, or sick. It is often used when someone appears or feels awful due to illness, fatigue, or other factors.

## 402. Feeling blue

“感到忧郁” 或 “感到沮丧”。

这个短语的起源常与航海有关，船只如果在船主或高级船员去世后会悬挂蓝色旗帜，人们因此将 “蓝色” 与忧郁联系在一起。此外，蓝色通常与悲伤、忧虑的情感色彩相关联。在现代英语中，形容一个人 “蓝色” 意味着他感到情绪低落或者精神状态不佳。

The origin of this phrase is often linked to maritime traditions; if a ship lost its captain or any senior officer while at sea, it would fly blue flags, thus associating “*blue*” with feelings of sadness. Additionally, the color blue is commonly related to emotions of sadness and melancholy. In modern English, describing someone as “*feeling blue*” means they feel down or are in a low mood.

- She’s been *feeling blue* ever since her pet dog passed away.自从她的小狗去世后，她一直很忧郁。

- Whenever I’m *feeling blue*, I listen to my favorite music.每当我感到沮丧时，我会听自己最喜欢的音乐。

## 403. Fender bender

fender：（汽车轮胎上的）挡泥板；防护板；

bender：弯管机；弯曲工具

“小刮擦” 或 “小车祸”。

这个短语指的是车辆之间的轻微碰撞，通常来说这种碰撞不会导致严重的损伤或人身伤害。“*Fender*” 指的是汽车的挡泥板，“*bender*” 则意味着弯曲或变形。这个表达形象地描述了轻微的碰撞导致车辆外观上小的损伤。

This phrase refers to a minor car accident, typically causing little damage or injury. The term “*fender*” denotes the part of a car that covers the wheel, and “*bender*” means something that gets bent or damaged. Thus, “*fender bender*” vividly describes a small collision leading to minor damage to the vehicle’s outer body.

- Luckily, it was just a *fender bender* and no one was hurt.幸运的是，这只是一场小车祸，没有人受伤。

## 404. Field day

“尽情享受” 或 “大显身手”。

“*Field day*” 最初指的是军事训练中的露天演习日。在这样的日子里，士兵们可以在户外进行各种活动和演习。后来，这个短语逐渐演变成一种比喻，用来形容一段时间内人们能够尽情享受或大展身手的情境。

The term “*field day*” originally referred to a day of outdoor military exercises. On such days, soldiers could engage in various activities and drills outdoors.

## 405. Fifteen minutes of fame

昙花一现” 或 “短暂的名声”。

这个短语来自于艺术家安迪·沃霍尔的一句著名格言：“在未来，每个人都能成名 15 分钟”。这句话表示的是在现代社会中，由于媒体的力量，每个人都有可能在某一时刻因某事件或某行为而瞬间成名，但这种名声通常是非常短暂的。

This phrase originates from a famous quote by artist Andy Warhol: “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.” It reflects the idea that in the modern media-driven world, everyone might achieve fame for a brief moment due to some event or action, but such fame is usually fleeting.

- She had her *fifteen minutes of fame* after appearing on the reality TV show.她在那个真人秀节目之后有了她的短暂名声。

## 407. Fight tooth and nail

“不惜一切代价拼搏” 或 “拼命争斗”。

这个短语起源于动物的战斗方式，动物在争斗时会用上它们的牙齿和爪子来作战，所以用 “牙齿和指甲” 来表示极为顽强的战斗。这个短语现今用来描述人们为实现目标或保护自己的利益而拼尽全力的情景。

This phrase originates from the way animals fight, using their teeth and claws in combat. Therefore, “*tooth and nail*” symbolizes an extremely fierce fight. Nowadays, this phrase is used to describe people striving hard to achieve their goals or to protect their interests.

This phrase originates from the helpless and unnatural state a fish finds itself in when out of water, unable to survive normally. Hence, when it’s used to describe someone, it means that the person feels very uneasy or uncomfortable in an unfamiliar or unsuitable environment.

This idiom originates from Middle English (*14th century*), where “*fiddle*” refers to the violin. A violin needs to be finely tuned before playing, ensuring it is in perfect condition.

This idiom stems from “fit,” which implies a sudden burst of activity, and “start,” which means to begin.

This phrase originates from around 5 PM when men, who shaved in the morning, show a faint regrowth of facial hair.

This phrase originates from the 19th century in the United States, when wagons were the primary means of transportation. If someone wronged you, and you either sabotaged or fixed their wagon to hinder their progress, it would mean you were making them suffer or punishing them.
