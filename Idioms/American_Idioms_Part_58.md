## 1141. The elephant in the room

“显而易见却被人忽视的问题”。

这个短语源自于一种极端的状况，即房间里有一只大象，但人们都假装看不见它。这主要用来形容一个显而易见的问题或事实，因为太过尴尬、敏感或复杂，人们选择避而不谈。该短语的使用提醒人们，虽然大的问题无法忽视，但却经常被巧妙地避开。

This phrase originates from an extreme situation where an elephant is in a room, but everyone pretends not to see it. It is mainly used to describe an obvious issue or fact that people choose to ignore because it is too awkward, sensitive, or complex. The use of this phrase reminds people that although big problems cannot be ignored, they are often cleverly avoided.

- We need to address the *elephant in the room* — why sales are declining.我们需要解决这个显而易见却被忽视的问题 —— 为什么销售额在下降。

- Discussing layoffs is the *elephant in the room* that nobody wants to mention.谈论裁员是一个显而易见却被忽视的问题，没有人愿意提及。

## 1142. The eleventh hour

“在最后一刻” 或 “在最后关头”。

这个短语源自《圣经》中的《马太福音》章节，其中提到一个主人在第十一小时雇用了一些工人。由此产生了 “*the eleventh hour*” 这个短语，用以描述到一个事情即将截止或结束的最后时刻做某事的情景。

This phrase originates from the Bible, specifically the book of Matthew, where a landowner hires workers at the eleventh hour. Hence, “*the eleventh hour*” evolved to describe a situation where something is done at the very last moment before a deadline or end.

- They presented their project at the *eleventh hour*.他们在最后一刻提交了他们的项目。

- I bought my plane ticket at the *eleventh hour*.我在最后关头买到了我的机票。

## 1143. The gift of the gab

gab： 美 [ɡæb] 闲谈；聊天；喋喋不休；

“伶牙俐齿” 或 “口才好”。

这个短语起源于爱尔兰神话，关于伯拉尼石（Blarney Stone）的传说。相传，亲吻伯拉尼石的人会获得某种特殊的能力，拥有出色的口才和说服力。因此，“the gift of the gab” 被用来形容那些善于表达、能言善辩的人。

This phrase originates from Irish folklore, particularly the legend of the Blarney Stone. Supposedly, anyone who kisses the Blarney Stone is granted the gift of eloquence and persuasive ability. Hence, “the gift of the gab” is used to describe people who are articulate and persuasive speakers.

- John has *the gift of the gab*; he can persuade anyone to buy anything.约翰有伶牙俐齿的本领，他能说服任何人购买任何东西。

- She certainly possesses *the gift of the gab*, making her a great salesperson.她确实拥有伶牙俐齿的口才，使她成为一名出色的销售员。

- Not everyone has *the gift of the gab*, but it can be developed with practice.并不是每个人天生都有伶牙俐齿，但通过练习可以培养这种能力。

## 1144. The last minute

“最后一刻” 或 “紧要关头”。

这个短语源于形象地描述时间快要用尽的情景，特别是即将到截止期限或完成某项任务的最后时刻。在现代英语中，“the last minute” 用来形容事情在最后关头才完成或者才决定的情况，常常包含紧张、仓促的含义。

This phrase metaphorically describes the scenario where time is almost running out, particularly when approaching a deadline or finishing a task. In modern English, “*the last minute*” is used to describe situations where something is completed or decided at the very last moment, often implying a sense of urgency or haste.

- He always does his homework at *the last minute*.他总是在最后一刻才做作业。

- The project was finished just in *the last minute*.这个项目是在最后一刻才完成的。

## 1145. The lion’s share

“最大份额” 或 “最好的一部分”。

这个短语来源于古希腊寓言作家伊索的故事。在这个寓言中，狮子、狐狸、狼和其他动物一起合作狩猎，但最终狮子声称自己应该得到最好的和最多的猎物。这也象征着在权力关系中，强者往往占据较大或最好的份额。

This phrase originates from a fable by the ancient Greek storyteller Aesop. In the fable, a lion, a fox, a wolf, and other animals hunt together, but the lion claims the best and largest portion of the prey for himself. This symbolizes that in power dynamics, the strongest often take the largest or best share.

- The manager took the lion’s share of the credit for the project’s success.经理把项目成功的最大功劳占为己有。

- Despite the team’s effort, the CEO received the lion’s share of the profits.尽管团队付出了努力，CEO 却获得了最大的利润份额。

- He always insists on getting the lion’s share of the inheritance.他总是坚持要得到遗产中最大的那一份。

## 1146. The long and short of it

“总之” 或 “长话短说”。

这个短语起源于莎士比亚的戏剧《温莎的风流娘们》中，原文是 “this is the long and short of it”，意在将事情的详细和概要都涵盖进来。如今，这个短语主要用来总结之前所说的话或是解释事件的关键点，起到概括长篇叙述的作用。

This phrase originated from Shakespeare’s play *The Merry Wives of Windsor*, where the original line is “this is the long and short of it”, intending to cover both details and summary. Nowadays, this phrase is commonly used to sum up what has been said or to explain the main point of an event, serving as a succinct version of a longer explanation.

- The long and short of it is that we missed the deadline.总之，我们错过了截止日期。

- She gave a long explanation, but the long and short of it is that she can’t come to the party.她做了很多解释，但总之她不能来参加聚会。

“嘴馋” 或 “突然之间很想吃零食”。

这个短语起源于对食物渴望的形象化描述，尤其是指人在某些特定情况下（例如受到某些药物影响或情绪波动）突然产生的强烈进食欲望。“*Munchies*” 是一个复数形式的名词，强调了这种吃零食的冲动。

This phrase originates from the depiction of a craving for food, especially referring to the sudden and intense desire to snack under certain conditions (such as the influence of specific drugs or emotional fluctuations). “*Munchies*” is a plural noun that emphasizes this impulse to eat snacks.

## 1148. The other day

“前几天” 或 “不久前”。

这个成语的确切来历已不可考，但它在口语中广泛使用，通常用来表示在不久前发生的事情。这是一个用来表述某件事在最近的过去发生的礼貌而常用的说法，可以指几天前、一周前甚至稍长一段时间前，具体取决于上下文。

This idiom’s exact origin is unclear, but it is widely used in spoken English to indicate that something happened fairly recently. It’s a polite and commonly used phrase to talk about events in the recent past, which can refer to a few days ago, a week ago, or even slightly longer, depending on the context.

## 1149. The patience of Job

“忍受极大的痛苦和麻烦的耐心”，或直译为 “约伯的耐心”。

这个短语来自《圣经•约伯记》的故事。约伯是一个虔诚的信徒，他无论遇到多么巨大的痛苦和困境，仍然对上帝保持着坚定的信仰和极大的耐心。因此，“the patience of Job” 用来形容一个人能够忍受长期的困境，而不失去信心或抱怨。

This idiom originates from the story of Job in the Bible. Job was a devout believer who faced immense suffering and hardship but maintained his faith and patience without faltering. Therefore, “the patience of Job” is used to describe someone who can endure long-lasting difficulties without losing faith or complaining.

- He must have *the patience of Job* to deal with all those difficult clients.他一定有约伯的耐心，才能应付那些难缠的客户。

## 1150. The pits

“最糟糕的情况” 或 “绝望的境地”。

这个短语起源于 “坑” 这个字面的意思，即一个黑暗、深而难以逃脱的地方。这个隐喻用法表示处于一个非常不好的情况或经历了非常不愉快的事情。

This phrase comes from the literal meaning of “pits,” which are dark, deep, and hard-to-escape places. This metaphorical usage signifies being in a very bad situation or experiencing something extremely unpleasant.

## 1151. The pot calling the kettle black

iron pots：铁锅

iron kettles：铁壶

“锅嫌壶黑” 或 “五十步笑百步”。

这个成语的来源可以追溯到 17 世纪。当时，人们通常使用铁锅和铁壶作为炊具，它们在火上经过一段时间的使用后都会变黑。因此，当一只已经变黑的锅指责同样变黑的壶时，这种指责就是自相矛盾的。这一成语常用于形容某人指责别人的弱点或缺点，但自己也有同样的弱点或缺点。

This idiom dates back to the 17th century. Back then, people commonly used iron pots and kettles for cooking, which would turn black due to the soot from the fire. Thus, it is contradictory for a blackened pot to criticize a blackened kettle. This idiom is often used to describe someone accusing others of flaws or faults that they themselves possess.

- When John complained about Sarah being late, it was like *the pot calling the kettle black* - he’s always late himself.当约翰抱怨萨拉迟到时，简直是锅嫌壶黑 —— 他自己也总是迟到。

## 1152. The road less travelled

“不寻常的选择” 或 “不同寻常的道路”。

这个短语源自美国诗人罗伯特 · 弗罗斯特（Robert Frost）的一首诗《未选择的路》（The Road Not Taken）。在这首诗中，诗人选择了一条较少人走的路，比喻他在生活中做出了不同寻常的决定。在现代使用中，这个短语用来描述那些不按照常规、不走寻常路的决定或选择，即选择冒险、独特或自己独创的路线。

This phrase originates from a poem by American poet Robert Frost titled “*The Road Not Taken*”. In the poem, the poet chooses a less-traveled path, symbolizing his unusual and distinctive decisions in life. Nowadays, the phrase is used to describe choices or decisions that do not follow the conventional path, implying an adventurous, unique, or independent route.

- She took *the road less travelled* and started her own business instead of working for a big company.她选择了不寻常的道路，开始了自己的生意，而不是为大公司打工。

## 1153. The same wavelength

wavelength：波长；（广播电台等占用的）频道；波道

“在同一频率上” 或 “有相同的想法或观点”。

这个短语源自于无线电通信技术，指两个设备在同一频率上才能相互通信。在日常用语中，这个短语用来比喻两个人或一群人之间达成一致，分享相同的观点或感觉，或彼此非常理解对方的意思。

## 1154. The school of hard knocks

“人生的挫折教育” 或 “社会大学”。

这个短语起源于 20 世纪初，用以形容通过实际生活中的艰难和困苦，特别是失败和错误，而不是通过正规的学校教育来获取人生经验和智慧。它强调的是通过亲身经历而学到的人生教训。

This phrase originates from the early 20th century and describes gaining life experience and wisdom through the hardships and challenges of real life, especially through failures and mistakes, rather than through formal schooling.

“换位思考” 或 “角色互换”。

这个短语最早在 19 世纪后期出现，用来形容角色或立场的互换。最初的背景是指鞋子在另一只脚上，由于左右脚鞋子的形状不同，这种换位会引发不同的感受。不仅仅是角色的物理交换，这个表达还延伸出对立场和情景的反转，以便更好地理解对方的处境。

This idiom originated in the late 19th century and describes a situation where roles or positions are reversed. The original context referred to the discomfort or different experience when a shoe is on the other foot, since shoes were distinctly designed for the left and right foot. This expression has evolved to mean the reversal of roles or situations, often to emphasize understanding from another’s perspective.

- Now that the shoe is on the other foot, he realizes how difficult her job was.现在角色互换了，他才意识到她的工作有多么困难。

- It feels weird when the shoe is on the other foot and you have to ask for help.当你需要请求帮助时，换位思考的感觉很奇怪。

- With the shoe on the other foot, she quickly changed her opinion about the policy.角色互换后，她很快对这个政策改变了看法。

## 1156. The short end of the stick

“吃亏” 或 “受到不平等对待”。

这个短语起源于古时候的斗殴或争端，人们常用棍子来评判谁该受到责罚或怪罪。有时候，有人会故意给一方一根很短的棍子，以表示他在争执中不占优势或者受到了不公平对待。渐渐地，这一短语就被广泛用于形容人们在某件事情中吃亏或受到不平等待遇。

This phrase originates from olden days when sticks were used in fights or disputes to judge who should be punished or blamed. Sometimes, a very short stick would be given to one side to symbolize that they were at a disadvantage or being treated unfairly. Over time, this idiom has come to be widely used to describe people being in a situation where they are at a disadvantage or unfairly treated.

“叫得响的轮子获得润滑” 或者 “会哭的孩子有奶吃”。

这个短语起源于机械领域，在早期的机器中，如果一个轮子发出吱吱声，意味着它需要润滑油。逐渐，这个短语被借用来形容那些爱抱怨的人往往能够得到更多的关注和优待。在现代社会中，用这个短语来表示那些抱怨或提出问题的人更容易得到解决和帮助。

This phrase originates from the mechanical field, where a wheel that made a squeaky noise indicated it needed lubrication. Gradually, this phrase was borrowed to describe people who complain often or loudly tend to receive more attention and privileges. In modern society, it signifies that those who raise issues or complaints are more likely to have their problems addressed and receive help.

squeaky：美 [ˈskwiki] 吱吱作响的；吱嘎声的；嘎吱作响的

“正道” 或 “正轨”。

这个短语源自《圣经》的《马太福音》7:14，其中提到 “门是窄的，路是小的，找到的人也不多”。因此，“*the straight and narrow*” 用来比喻一个人遵守道德规范和法律，走正道，避免不良行为。

This phrase originates from the Bible, specifically Matthew 7:14, which states “narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.” Consequently, “the straight and narrow” is used to metaphorically describe someone adhering to moral and legal standards, following the righteous path, and avoiding wrongdoing.

This idiom originates from the phenomenon of tides in oceanography. When the tide goes out or comes in, it signifies a noticeable change. Figuratively, this phrase is used to describe a significant shift in circumstances, often implying a change from a worse situation to a better one, or vice versa.

## 1160. The tip of the iceberg

“冰山一角”。

这个短语借用了冰山的物理特性：只有一小部分漂浮在水面上，而大部分则隐藏在水面以下。因此，“the tip of the iceberg” 常用来表示某个问题或情况中仅显露出来的小部分，而更大的部分还未被察觉或展示出来。

This phrase draws from the physical property of icebergs, where only a small portion is visible above water, while the majority is hidden below the surface. Therefore, “*the tip of the iceberg*” is often used to convey that what is visible or known is only a small part of a larger, more complex issue or situation.
