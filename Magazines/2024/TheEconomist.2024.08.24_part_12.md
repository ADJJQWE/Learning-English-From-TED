原文：

THERE WERE nearly 32,000 rapes reported in India in 2022, the latest year

for which data are publicly available, according to the national crime records

bureau. That number hugely understates how common sexual violence is in

the country. Most incidents are never reported. Those that are rarely make

the news.

根据国家犯罪记录局的数据，2022年，印度报告了近3.2万起强奸案，这是公开数据的最近一年。这个数字大大低估了性暴力在这个国家的普遍程度。大多数事件从未被报道。那些很少成为新闻。

原文：

Once in a while a particularly gruesome case leads to national outrage. So it

went in 2012, when a 23-year-old student was gang-raped on a bus in Delhi

before being left for dead by the side of the road. She later died of her

injuries. Or in 2020, when a 19-year-old Dalit farmworker was gang-raped 

in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, allegedly by a group of upper-caste

men from her village. She, too, died.

偶尔，一个特别可怕的案件会引发全国公愤。2012年也是如此，一名23岁的学生在德里的公交车上被轮奸，然后被扔在路边等死。她后来因伤势过重而死亡。或者在2020年，一名19岁的贱民农场工人在北部的北方邦被轮奸，据称是被她村子里的一群高种姓男子所为。她也死了。

原文：

And so it has been over the past couple of weeks, following the rape and

murder on August 9th of a 31-year-old trainee doctor during her night shift

in a hospital in Kolkata, the capital of the eastern state of West Bengal.

Women across the country have taken to the streets demanding safety from

violence and equality at work and in public life. Doctors have gone on strike

for better working conditions. The outrage is important, says Vrinda Grover,

a lawyer and activist: “It says this is wrong, and we as a society won’t

condone this violence.”

8月9日，一名31岁的实习医生在东部西孟加拉邦首府加尔各答的一家医院值夜班时被强奸并谋杀，这一事件发生在过去的几周里。全国各地的妇女走上街头，要求在工作和公共生活中免受暴力和平等。医生为争取更好的工作条件而罢工。律师兼社会活动家维伦达·格罗弗说，这种愤慨是很重要的:“它说这是错误的，我们作为一个社会不会宽恕这种暴力。”

学习：

trainee：实习生；练习生；见习生；培训生

trainee doctor：实习医生

Kolkata：美 [kɔlˈkʌtə] 加尔各答；加尔格达（印度城市）

condone：美 [kənˈdoʊn] 宽恕；原谅

原文：

Yet outrage has done little in recent years to improve the lives of Indian

women. The number of reported rapes in the country was higher in 2022

than a decade before. That may be due to greater willingness to report such

crimes, but it is hardly a sign that the risk of falling victim to one has been

reduced. Public spaces still belong firmly to men, with women expected to

keep themselves safe when they venture beyond the confines of home

(which is often hardly safe, either).

然而，近年来，愤怒并没有改善印度妇女的生活。2022年，该国报告的强奸案数量高于十年前。这可能是因为人们更愿意举报此类犯罪，但这并不能说明成为犯罪受害者的风险已经降低。公共空间仍然牢牢地属于男人，女人们被期望在走出家门时保护自己的安全(这通常也不安全)。

学习：

fall victim to：成为xxx的受害者

原文：

One reason is that the government is not enforcing its own laws. The case in

Kolkata, for instance, might have been prevented if the doctor had had

access to a safe resting space, as is already required by India’s workplace

safety rules. And while high-profile cases such as the one in 2012 have been

fast-tracked through special tribunals, the legal process for most victims

remains painfully slow and unpromising, with only about a quarter of cases

that go to trial resulting in a conviction.

一个原因是政府没有执行自己的法律。例如，如果医生能够按照印度工作场所安全规则的要求，获得一个安全的休息空间，加尔各答的案例可能就可以避免。尽管像2012年这样的高知名度案件已经通过特别法庭得到快速处理，但对大多数受害者来说，法律程序仍然缓慢得令人痛苦，没有希望，只有大约四分之一的案件进入审判并最终定罪。

学习：

high-profile：高知名度；高调的；高姿态的；备受瞩目的；

legal process：法律程序；法律流程；

tribunals：美 [traɪˈbju:nəlz] 裁决；法庭；法院；（tribunal的复数）

原文：

Meanwhile, violence against women is still widely considered acceptable.

Nearly half of Indians surveyed by the government between 2019 and 2021,

men and women both, said that a husband was sometimes justified in

beating his wife for offences such as “disrespecting” his parents or going out

without asking his permission. Marital rape is not a crime.

与此同时，对妇女的暴力仍然被广泛认为是可以接受的。政府在2019年至2021年期间调查的近一半印度人，无论男女，都表示，丈夫有时有理由因“不尊重”父母或未经允许外出等罪行殴打妻子。婚内强奸不是犯罪。

学习：

beat his wife：殴打妻子

原文：

Narendra Modi, the prime minister, alluded to the problem of violence

against women in his Independence Day speech on August 15th, without

specifically mentioning the case in Kolkata. His main recommendation was

to “instil fear” through harsher punishments. Rekha Sharma, chairwoman of

the National Commission for Women under Mr Modi’s previous

government, blamed the government of West Bengal, which is led by an

opposition party. She has previously said that highlighting the problem of

sexual violence was akin to “defaming” the country. India is hardly alone in

needing to tackle violence against women. But politicians remain unserious

about curbing it. ■

总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在8月15日的独立日演讲中提到了针对女性的暴力问题，但没有具体提到加尔各答的案件。他的主要建议是通过更严厉的惩罚来“灌输恐惧”。莫迪前政府全国妇女委员会主席雷克哈·莎尔玛指责由反对党领导的西孟加拉邦政府。她之前说过，强调性暴力问题类似于“诽谤”这个国家。印度并不是唯一一个需要解决针对女性暴力问题的国家。但是政治家们对遏制它仍然不认真。■

学习：

allude to：提到

akin to：类似于          

curb：遏制
