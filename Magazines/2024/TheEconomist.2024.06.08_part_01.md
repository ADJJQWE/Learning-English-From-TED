**Hunter Biden’s** trial in Delaware began this week. Prosecutors allege that

the president’s son lied about using drugs while buying a revolver in 2018.

Another trial, over allegations that he failed to pay his taxes, is due in

September. It had seemed that Mr Biden might avoid the two ordeals

altogether, until his plea deal with prosecutors fell apart last year.

亨特·拜登在特拉华州的审判于本周开始。检察官指控总统的儿子在2018年购买左轮手枪时谎称吸毒。另一场针对他逃税指控的审判将于9月份进行。拜登似乎可以完全避免这两项考验，直到去年他与检方的认罪协议破裂。

plea：恳求；请求

A "plea deal" (or "plea bargain") is an agreement in a criminal case between the prosecutor and the defendant, where the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a particular charge in return for some concession from the prosecutor. This might involve the defendant pleading guilty to a lesser charge, receiving a lighter sentence, or having other charges dropped. Plea deals are often used to avoid the time and expense of a full trial, and they can result in a quicker resolution of the case. In the context of Hunter Biden's situation, his plea deal falling apart means that an agreement he had reached with prosecutors did not go through as planned, leading to the continuation of his legal ordeals.

“plea deal”（认罪协议）是指在刑事案件中，检察官与被告之间达成的一项协议。根据该协议，被告同意对某项指控认罪，以换取检察官做出某些让步。这些让步可能包括被告认罪较轻的罪名、获得较轻的刑罚或撤销其他指控。认罪协议通常用于避免全面审判的时间和费用，从而更快地解决案件。在亨特·拜登的情况下，他与检察官达成的认罪协议未能如计划中那样通过，这导致了他的法律问题继续进行。



fall apart：（协议）破裂
