last week at NeurIPS’24, one extremely salient thing was the anxiety and frustration felt and expressed by late-year PhD students and postdocs who were confused by the job market that looks and feels so much different from what they expected perhaps when they were applying for PhD programs five or so years ago. and, some of these PhD students and postdocs are my own under my supervision. this makes me reflect upon what is going on or what has been going on in artificial intelligence research *and* development. this post will be more of less a stream of thoughts rather than a well-structured piece (though, as if i ever wrote a well-structured, well-thought-out, well-prepared blog post.)

上周在NeurIPS的24届大会上，一件非常突出的事情是高年级博士生和博士后所感受到和表达的焦虑和沮丧，他们对就业市场感到困惑，这个市场看起来和感觉上与他们大约五年前申请博士课程时的预期大相径庭。而且，这些博士生和博士后，有一部分是我自己在我的指导下的。这让我反思人工智能研究和发展中正在发生或已经发生的事情。这篇文章或多或少会是一个思想流，而不是一篇结构良好的文章(尽管，好像我曾经写过一篇结构良好、深思熟虑、准备充分的博客文章。)

late-year PhD students：高年级博士生

原文：

the past decade or so has been an interesting time for machine learning, or more broadly artificial intelligence. starting with speech recognition in 2010 or so, deep learning has shown dramatic improvements over then-existing states of the art in a variety of challenging and also practical problems, such as object recognition from images and machine translation. by 2014, it was pretty clear that something big was going to happen and that every major company, both tech and not, wanted to ensure that they are part of this ongoing revolution and benefit from it.

对于机器学习，或者更广义的人工智能来说，过去十年左右是一个有趣的时期。从2010年左右的语音识别开始，深度学习在各种具有挑战性的实际问题上，如从图像和机器翻译中识别对象，已经显示出超过当时现有技术水平的巨大进步。到2014年，很明显，一些大事情将会发生，每一家大公司，无论是科技公司还是非科技公司，都希望确保自己是这场持续革命的一部分，并从中受益。

原文：

because deep learning hadn’t been anything close to mainstream then for many years, there was almost no undergraduate curriculum where basic ideas and techniques behind deep learning were taught seriously. in fact, artificial neural nets were mentioned barely in passing in many machine learning and artificial intelligence courses back then. this created a great discrepancy between supply and demand of deep learning talents, forcing these companies, who were able to see this revolution earlier than the others could, to aggressively recruit PhD students from a small number of labs across the world.

因为深度学习多年来都没有接近主流，所以几乎没有本科课程认真教授深度学习背后的基本思想和技术。事实上，在当时的许多机器学习和人工智能课程中，人工神经网络几乎没有被提及。这造成了深度学习人才的供需之间的巨大差异，迫使这些能够比其他公司更早看到这场革命的公司积极从世界各地的少数实验室招募博士生。

学习：

 undergraduate curriculum ：本科课程

原文：

because there were only a handful of labs in the world that were seriously pursuing deep learning (unlike how it is now,) there was a fierce competition over the graduates as well as even professors of these labs. this fierce competition naturally led to a greatly increased level of compensation for these PhD’s with experiences and expertise in artificial neural networks. this made the gap between the academic compensation and the industry compensation even greater in this particular area within the field of artificial intelligence, making it extremely challenging for universities to recruit some of them to educate their students. in fact, i was one of those very few who graduated between 2010 and 2015 with PhD, working on artificial neural nets during the PhD years, and joined a university as a tenure-track faculty member. this of course led to a great delay in ramping up the supply of talents, while the demand continued to soar.

因为世界上只有少数几个实验室在认真追求深度学习(不像现在这样)，所以对这些实验室的毕业生甚至教授进行了激烈的竞争。这种激烈的竞争自然导致这些拥有人工神经网络经验和专业知识的博士的薪酬水平大幅提高。这使得在人工智能领域的这一特定领域，学术薪酬和行业薪酬之间的差距更大，使大学招募其中一些人来教育学生变得极具挑战性。事实上，我是极少数在2010年至2015年间获得博士学位的人之一，在博士期间从事人工神经网络的研究，并作为终身教职员工加入了一所大学。这当然导致了人才供给的大幅延迟，而需求却在持续飙升。

a tenure-track faculty ：终身教职

原文：

an interesting side effect of such a fierce competition was that these companies were recruiting them even if they may not contribute directly to either top or bottom lines. these companies were hiring them to prepare themselves for the inevitable and imminent revolution that would change everything they do. a lot of these PhD’s hired back then were therefore asked to and free to *do research*; that is, they chose what they want to work on and they publish what they want to publish. it was just like an academic research position however with 2-5x better compensation as well as external visibility and without teaching duties, administrative overhead as well as pressure to constantly write grant proposals. what a fantastic opportunity!

如此激烈竞争的一个有趣的副作用是，这些公司正在招募他们，即使他们可能不会直接对公司的收入或利润做出贡献。这些公司雇佣他们来为不可避免且迫在眉睫的变革做准备，这场变革将改变他们所做的一切。因此，当时雇佣的许多博士被要求自由地做研究；也就是说，他们选择了他们想要研究的东西，并且发表了他们想要发表的东西。这就像一个学术研究职位，但是有2-5倍的更好的报酬和外部可见性，没有教学任务，行政管理费用以及不断写赠款提案的压力。多好的机会啊！

compensation：薪酬；报酬；工资；薪水

原文：

i suspect that this wasn’t lost to students, both college and high school (if not middle school). there was an opportunity with amazing financial compensation, cushy benefits and freedom to choose their favourite topic to work on, as long as it was within the realm of artificial intelligence (to be frank, who doesn’t work on AI, i guess?) this opportunity seemed to be available however only to PhD’s who have published academic papers on artificial neural nets. this led to a flood of PhD applicants applying to become (now so-called) AI PhD students.

我怀疑这并没有失去学生，无论是大学还是高中(如果不是初中)。有一个机会，有惊人的经济补偿、轻松的福利和选择他们最喜欢的主题进行工作的自由，只要是在人工智能领域内(坦率地说，我猜谁不从事人工智能工作？)然而，这个机会似乎只有在人工神经网络方面发表过学术论文的博士才有。这导致了大量博士申请者申请成为(现在所谓的)人工智能博士生。

原文：

the flood of applicants does not necessarily mean that we would end up with a large number of PhD students, since the constraint on the number of PhD students is not the number of applicants but rather the number of available faculty advisors. although i did mention earlier that there were only a handful of labs 15 years or so ago working on artificial neural nets, by 2016, a lot of professors had already pivoted their labs to become deep learning labs and were aggressively expanding their labs by admitting a large number of PhD students.

申请人的涌入并不一定意味着我们最终会有大量的博士生，因为博士生数量的限制不是申请人的数量，而是可用的指导教师的数量。虽然我之前提到过，大约15年前只有少数实验室在研究人工神经网络，但到了2016年，许多教授已经将他们的实验室转变为深度学习实验室，并通过招收大量博士生来积极扩展他们的实验室。

原文：

so, it seemed like we had created a great pipeline of AI talent. a large number of brilliant students apply to PhD programs. a large number of professors in AI admit and train these brilliant students to become next-generation PhDs. a small number of major tech companies and others recruit them with unimaginably good compensation and research freedom.

因此，看起来我们已经创造了一个伟大的人工智能人才管道。大量优秀的学生申请博士课程。AI的大量教授承认并培养这些优秀的学生成为下一代博士。少数大型科技公司和其他公司以难以想象的优厚报酬和研究自由招聘他们。

原文：

this wasn’t however sustainable, perhaps obviously in hindsight. the only way for this to continue was for deep learning to continue to be something that can revolutionize the industry (if not the whole society) in five years and that it had to be in five years every year. as mentioned earlier, companies were recruiting these talents and investing in the environments in which they conduct research, in anticipation of this inevitable change in the future. in other words, it had to be the future they were preparing for, in order for this pipeline to continue.

然而，这是不可持续的，也许事后看来很明显。这种情况继续下去的唯一方式是深度学习继续成为在五年内可以彻底改变行业(如果不是整个社会)的东西，并且它必须在五年内每年都这样做。如前所述，公司正在招募这些人才，并投资于他们开展研究的环境，以应对未来不可避免的变化。换句话说，为了让这条路径继续下去，他们必须为未来做好准备。

原文：

once the first generation of lucky PhD’s (including me!) who were there not out of career prospects but mostly out of luck (or unluck), we started to have a series of much more brilliant and purpose-driven PhD’s working on deep learning. because these people were extremely motivated and were selected not by luck but by their merits and zeal, they started to make a much faster and more visible progress. soon afterward, this progress started to show up as actual products. in particular, large-scale models, represented by but not exclusively by large-scale conversational language models, began to show that these products are truly the revolutionary products that can both change the future and produce economical values in the present. in other words, these new generations of brilliant PhD’s have successfully brought the future into the present by productizing deep learning in the forms of large-scale conversational language models and their variants.

曾经的第一代幸运博士(包括我！)他们不是出于职业前景，而是出于运气(或不幸)，我们开始有一系列更聪明、更有目的的博士从事深度学习。因为这些人非常积极，不是靠运气而是靠他们的优点和热情被选中的，他们开始取得更快更明显的进步。不久之后，这一进展开始作为实际产品出现。特别是，以大规模会话语言模型为代表但不仅限于此的大规模模型开始表明，这些产品是真正的革命性产品，既能改变未来，又能在当前产生经济价值。换句话说，这些新一代杰出的博士们通过以大规模会话语言模型及其变体的形式将深度学习产品化，成功地将未来带入了现在。

原文：

productization implies a lot of things, but there are two aspects that are particularly important to this note. first, productization requires some kind of standardization in development and deployment processes. such process standardization is however antithetical to scientific research. we do not need a constant and frequent stream of creative and disruptive innovations but incremental and stable improvements based on standardized processes. PhD’s are lousy at this, because this is precisely the opposite of what PhD programs are designed to train them for. PhD’s are supposed to come up with innovative ideas (yes, debatable if every idea is innovative, but it tends to be at least innovative with a lot of noise,) validate these ideas either theoretically or empirically, repot the findings to the community by writing papers and then move on. once something becomes an actual product (or a product category,) we cannot simply innovate and move on, but need to stick with it to support it continuously. with a well-established system of processes, the necessity of PhD degrees disappears rapidly.

产品化隐含了很多东西，但有两个方面对本笔记特别重要。首先，产品化需要在开发和部署过程中实现某种标准化。然而，这种过程标准化与科学研究是对立的。我们不需要持续和频繁的创造性和破坏性创新，而是基于标准化流程的渐进和稳定的改进。博士们在这方面很糟糕，因为这恰恰与博士课程设计培养他们的目的相反。博士应该提出创新的想法(是的，如果每个想法都是创新的，那是有争议的，但它往往至少是有很多噪音的创新)，从理论上或经验上验证这些想法，通过写论文向社区报告发现，然后继续前进。一旦某样东西成为实际的产品(或产品类别)，我们不能简单地创新和继续前进，而是需要坚持下去，以持续支持它。有了完善的流程体系，博士学位的必要性迅速消失。

antithetical：美 [ˌæntɪˈθetɪkl] 对立的；矛盾的；对照的；完全相反的

原文：

second, productization creates a visible and concrete path to revenue. this is a great thing for the companies who have invested in recruiting these amazing talents and providing them resources to innovate within their organization rather than somewhere else. unfortunately, once there is a concrete path to revenue (and ultimately to profit), it becomes increasingly more difficult for researchers to continue to ask for full research freedom. many will be asked to directly contribute to products (or product categories) and justify their compensation as well as employment overall, and only a few will be allowed continued freedom in research. this is only natural, and probably why in most organizations (including for-profit, non-profit, government, etc.) research teams are often significantly smaller than and given less resources than product teams.

第二，产品化创造了一条看得见的、具体的创收路径。对于那些投资招募这些优秀人才并为他们提供资源在其组织内而不是其他地方进行创新的公司来说，这是一件好事。不幸的是，一旦有了获得收入(并最终获得利润)的具体途径，研究人员继续要求充分的研究自由就变得越来越困难。许多人将被要求直接为产品(或产品类别)做出贡献，并证明他们的薪酬以及总体雇佣情况，只有少数人将被允许继续自由从事研究。这是很自然的，也可能是为什么在大多数组织中(包括营利组织、非营利组织、政府等)。)研究团队通常比产品团队小得多，获得的资源也少得多。

原文：

furthermore, during the past few years, universities have somewhat caught up with the demand and started to educate, train and graduate undergraduate and master’s students on fundamentals and practical ideas behind these new technologies. they know how to train these models, test these models and deploy these models, in addition to theoretical ideas behind them. even better, they are less egotistical on average than PhD’s and are often more open-minded.

此外，在过去几年中，大学在一定程度上赶上了需求，并开始就这些新技术背后的基本原理和实用理念对本科生和硕士生进行教育、培训和毕业。他们知道如何训练这些模型，测试这些模型，部署这些模型，除了这些模型背后的理论思想。更好的是，平均来说，他们比博士更少自我，而且思想更开放。

原文：

these factors together completely shatter the AI talent pipeline outlined earlier. companies do not need as many PhD’s as before, since they can recruit bachelor’s or master’s students who can contribute immediately and directly to AI-based products following the standardized process. students do not need to enter PhD programs to learn necessary skills to do so, since universities can train them as part of their undergraduate curriculum. the current crop of PhD students, who joined the programs even slightly due to the positive career prospect based on this AI talent pipeline, are being left out of this big reorganization of the AI talent pipeline.

这些因素一起完全粉碎了前面概述的人工智能人才管道。公司不需要像以前那样多的博士，因为他们可以招募学士或硕士学生，这些学生可以按照标准化的流程立即直接为基于人工智能的产品做出贡献。学生们不需要进入博士课程来学习必要的技能，因为大学可以把它们作为本科课程的一部分来培训。目前这批博士生，由于基于这一人工智能人才渠道的积极职业前景而加入了该计划，但被排除在人工智能人才渠道的大重组之外。

crop of ：一批

at this point, it is perhaps unsurprising that these students near the end of their PhD programs are feeling a greatly heightened level of anxiety and frustration. they looked up to people of my generation (still relatively young and junior, but in this field, probably on the more senior side) and thought they would enjoy similar career prospects by becoming extremely highly paid research scientists at big tech companies with a great degree of research freedom, as long as their PhD degrees were somewhat relevant to a broad field of machine learning and adjacent areas. from their perspective, the job market suddenly asks them to show their credentials in terms of innovating in a much narrower domain of large-scale language models and their variants and to work on directly contributing to these products built on top of these large-scale models. there are much fewer opportunities if they do not want to work on productizing large-scale language models, and these positions are disappearing quickly.

在这一点上，这些即将结束博士课程的学生感到焦虑和沮丧的程度大大提高，这也许并不令人惊讶。他们看得起我这一代人(仍然相对年轻和初级，但在这个领域，可能是更高级的一方)，并认为他们会享受类似的职业前景，成为大型科技公司的高薪研究科学家，有很大的研究自由，只要他们的博士学位与机器学习的广泛领域和相邻领域有一定的相关性。从他们的角度来看，就业市场突然要求他们在大规模语言模型及其变体的更狭窄领域的创新方面展示他们的资质，并致力于直接为建立在这些大规模模型之上的这些产品做出贡献。如果他们不想从事大规模语言模型的产品化工作，机会就会少得多，而且这些职位正在迅速消失。

原文：

that said, i must emphasize that this does not mean at all that research topics in AI outside these large-scale models are not important nor sought after. for instance, at Prescient Design, we have been continuously hiring PhD-level research scientists who specialize in uncertainty quantification, causal machine learning, geometric deep learning, computer vision and more, because research and development in these areas are directly relevant to what we do, that is, lab-in-the-loop antibody design.

也就是说，我必须强调，这并不意味着这些大规模模型之外的人工智能研究主题不重要，也不受欢迎。例如，在Prescient Design，我们一直在不断聘用专攻不确定性量化、因果机器学习、几何深度学习、计算机视觉等领域的博士级研究科学家，因为这些领域的研发与我们的工作直接相关，即实验室在环抗体设计。

原文：

large-scale models are just one particular sub-area of AI that have received a lot of attention in recent years. i am incredibly excited by advances and progress from these large-scale models, but they are not the only one that deserves attention and investment. such an outrageously heightened level of attention at large-scale language models and their variants however easily blinds us, and in particular those who are still students as well as even faculty members at these so-called elite universities. regardless, attention, however well or not justified, comes with a greater level of opportunities, and it is only natural for students to feel anxious if they hadn’t produced nor are producing papers on large-scale models, as these opportunities may not be available to them.

大规模模型只是近年来受到大量关注的人工智能的一个特定子领域。我对这些大型模型的进步和发展感到非常兴奋，但它们不是唯一值得关注和投资的。然而，对大规模语言模型及其变体的这种惊人的高度关注很容易蒙蔽我们，尤其是那些在这些所谓的精英大学仍然是学生甚至教师的人。不管怎样，注意力，不管是好是坏，都伴随着更多的机会，如果学生们没有也没有在大规模模型上发表论文，他们会感到焦虑是很自然的，因为他们可能没有这些机会。

原文：

at this point, it feels like the heightened anxiety and frustration i sensed from talking to and hearing from senior PhD students and postdocs at NeurIPS’24 last week was well justified. some of them probably feel betrayed, as the gap between what they were promised earlier and what they see now is growing rapidly. some of them probably feel helpless, as their choice of research topics and their work on these topics seem less welcome at these companies. some of them probably feel defeated, as bachelor’s or master’s students seem to be better versed at training and deploying these large-scale models and look to be considered more valuable than they are. it must be frustrating and anxiety-inducing.

在这一点上，上周在NeurIPS'24上，我从与资深博士生和博士后的交谈中感受到的高度焦虑和沮丧是有道理的。他们中的一些人可能感到被背叛了，因为他们之前得到的承诺和现在看到的差距正在迅速扩大。他们中的一些人可能会感到无助，因为他们选择的研究课题和他们在这些课题上的工作在这些公司似乎不太受欢迎。他们中的一些人可能会感到失败，因为学士或硕士学生似乎更擅长训练和部署这些大规模模型，并看起来被认为比他们更有价值。这一定令人沮丧和焦虑。

原文：

unfortunately i could only work my way through (partly) understanding the source of anxiety and frustration i could sense from these immensely brilliant students but cannot think of a way to help alleviate such frustration. after all, it looks like i may have greatly but unintentionally contributed to the situation that makes them frustrated and anxious about their careers and future. sorry!

不幸的是，我只能(部分地)理解我能从这些非常优秀的学生身上感受到的焦虑和沮丧的来源，但却想不出有助于减轻这种沮丧的方法。毕竟，看起来我可能在很大程度上无意中造成了这种局面，让他们对自己的职业生涯和未来感到沮丧和焦虑。不好意思！
