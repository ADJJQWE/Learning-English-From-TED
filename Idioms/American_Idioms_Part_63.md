## 1241. To stand up for

“为……挺身而出” 或 “支持”。

这个短语的来历可以追溯到食品制作的领域，特别是烘焙。在过去，所有的食材都得从头准备，没有预混合的粉或现成的配料。这种使用从零开始准备所有食材的过程，后来演变为表示将某事物或计划完全重新开始的表达。

This phrase originates from the field of cooking, particularly baking, where all ingredients had to be prepared from scratch, with no pre-mixed flour or ready-made components.

stonewall：阻挠；妨碍；拖延；

“阻挠” 或 “故意拖延”。

这个短语起源于 “墙” 的概念，意指像一堵坚固的墙一样阻挡或拖延进展。最初是在美国南北战争时，邦联将军托马斯·“石墙”·杰克逊因在战斗中坚决防守而得名”Stonewall Jackson”，之后演变为指故意拖延或阻挠某事进展，特别是在讨论或谈判中。

The phrase originates from the concept of a “wall,” meaning to block or delay progress as firmly as a wall would. It first became popular during the American Civil War when Confederate General Thomas “*Stonewall*” Jackson earned his nickname for his firm defensive stance in battle. Over time, it evolved to describe the act of deliberately delaying or obstructing progress, especially in discussions or negotiations.

“为某人减轻负担” 或 “替某人分担压力”。

这个短语可能源自于人们体力劳动中的情景，尤其是在搬运重物时，如果有人能帮忙担下一部分重量，那就能显着减轻搬运者的负担。在现代语境中，这个短语常用来表示从精神或责任上减轻某人所承受的压力或负担。

This phrase likely originates from physical labor situations, especially when carrying heavy loads; if someone helps take part of the weight, it significantly reduces the burden for the carrier.

这个短语起源于英语中的 “*easy*” 一词，其意为 “轻松的，容易的”。当人们告诉别人 “*to take it easy*” 时，他们是建议放松心情，减轻压力或者放缓当前的节奏。这可以用在大多数日常情境中，不论是工作、学习还是生活中。

This phrase originates from the English word “easy,” which means “relaxed or without difficulty.” When people tell someone “to take it easy,” they are advising them to relax, reduce stress, or slow down their current pace.

This phrase can be traced back to early English usage of “for granted,” implying that something is assumed to be certain or unquestionable and hence often overlooked or not appreciated. In contemporary society, the phrase is typically used to describe things or people that are not adequately valued or appreciated.

This phrase originates from the structure of a sword, where the “*hilt*” is the handle of the sword. “*To the hilt*” means to thrust the sword in completely until only the hilt is left visible. The metaphor was extended to mean doing something fully or completely, without holding back.

This phrase originates from Britain and originally referred to boots being too large for their wearer.

This phrase comes from the work of blacksmiths, who might put multiple iron tools in the fire at once to heat them and then shape them.

This phrase originates from the 19th century, initially referring to the adjustment levers on old-fashioned hand-cranked clocks.
