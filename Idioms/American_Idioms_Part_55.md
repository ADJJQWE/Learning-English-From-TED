“显得非常突兀” 或 “格格不入”。

这个短语直译为 “像一个痛拇指一样突出”，形象地比喻某个事物或人在人群中显得特别扎眼或不协调。痛拇指通常是红肿的，很显眼，所以这个短语用来描述某人或某物显得异常明显或者与周围环境不符。

This phrase translates literally as “protrude like a sore thumb,” vividly illustrating something or someone who stands out awkwardly or is conspicuously different. A sore thumb is usually red and swollen, very noticeable, hence this idiom is used to describe something or someone that is exceptionally conspicuous or out of place.

This phrase originates from a military term, which referred to soldiers staying at their posts and not abandoning their cannons or firearms during a battle. It later evolved into a common expression in everyday language, meaning to remain steadfast in one’s beliefs or decisions despite pressure or opposition.

## 1084. Stick-in-the-mud

This phrase originates from a vivid metaphor: imagine a person stuck in the mud, unable to move and hence unable to progress. “Stick-in-the-mud” is used to describe those who are set in their ways and resistant to new ideas or changes.

This phrase originates from the idea that a thief’s fingers become “*sticky*” when they commit a theft and grab valuable items. Hence, “*sticky fingers*” vividly describes those who are in the habit of taking things that do not belong to them.
