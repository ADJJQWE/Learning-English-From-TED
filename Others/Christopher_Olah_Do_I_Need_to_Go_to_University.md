Instead of asking “Is university good?”, ask “Do I have something more compelling to do?”

Posted on May 30th, 2020

*This essay collects thoughts I've had over several years, and doesn't attempt to address present changes in whether it makes sense to attend university due to COVID.*

I’ve been somewhat successful as a researcher without an undergraduate degree or PhD. As a result, I often have people ask me about whether it’s possible to be successful without going to university, whether they personally should, or whether I can help them persuade their parents. At this point, I've probably received around a hundred emails on this topic. It's still hard to know how to respond.

I’m reluctant to encourage people I don’t know well to take non-traditional paths, because I think they’re riskier and depend a lot on the person. In fact, I suspect that many of the people who write to me would be well served by going to university. At the same time, I think alternative paths can be a great choice for some people -- in some cases, significantly better than going to university.

Unfortunately, society isn’t very well set up to support and validate young people for whom this is the better choice. So, if you’re considering doing such a thing, you not only need to reason about whether it’s a good decision, but may also need to navigate tricky emotional and social challenges.

I suspect that some people who write to me are really looking for validation and support of their preference to not go to university. Unfortunately, I’m not well positioned to give that support, because I don’t know them well.

What I can give, and what this essay aims to do, is to share thoughts on ways to think about the decision, navigating the social and emotional challenges, and resources you may find helpful.	

## Ways of Thinking about the Decision

My first suggestion is to compare university to concrete alternatives. Instead of asking “Is university good?”, ask “Do I have something more **compelling** to do?”. Instead of “Should I do a PhD?”, ask “Where can I find the best environment to grow as a researcher?”. And so forth.

>
>
>In this context, **"compelling"** means **"convincing, attractive, or persuasive"**—something that strongly draws attention, interest, or enthusiasm.
>
>Detailed Explanation:
>
>When the author says **"something more compelling to do"**, they are referring to an **alternative option that is more appealing, meaningful, or beneficial** than going to university. It implies that the alternative should be so strong or attractive that it provides a **clear and persuasive reason** to choose it over university.
>
>Example Sentences:
>
>1. *She received a **compelling** job offer that made her reconsider finishing her degree.*
>    她收到了一个极具吸引力的工作邀请，这让她重新考虑是否要完成学位。
>2. *The documentary provided **compelling** evidence of climate change.*
>    这部纪录片提供了关于气候变化的令人信服的证据。
>3. *He didn’t have a **compelling** argument for quitting his job.*
>    他没有一个令人信服的理由辞职。
>
>Comparison with Similar Words:
>
>- **Attractive**: Focuses on visual or emotional appeal rather than intellectual or logical reasoning.
>- **Persuasive**: Focuses more on influencing opinions or decisions through argument or reasoning.
>- **Convincing**: Highlights logical strength, often used for arguments or evidence rather than actions or choices.
>
>In Context:
>
>The author suggests **reframing the question** from a vague assessment of university's value ("Is university good?") to a **comparison with specific, attractive alternatives** ("Do I have something more compelling to do?"). This approach encourages critical thinking about **better opportunities** instead of viewing the decision in isolation.





Spending a year doing something else is almost always reversible: if you end up wanting to go back to university, it was just a gap year. As a result, the most important question is whether it will be time well spent and that requires you to think about what specifically you’ll be doing.



If your plan is to learn or work on projects independently, it’s worth thinking especially carefully. This can be great -- I did it for three years and grew a lot as a result -- but it can also very easily fail. Some important questions to ask yourself are:

- Do I have things I deeply want to spend a year of my life exploring or working on?
- Do I have a way to support myself that leaves me time and energy to grow?
- Can I really work self-directed for months at a time? Do I have examples of me working hard on a personal project or learning without external structure?
- Do I have or can I learn the skills I need to work on this project independently?
- Do I have sources of community, peer support or mentorship for what I want to do?

学习：

self-directed：自我指导的；自主的；自我管理的；自我导向的



>如果你的计划是独立学习或从事项目，那就特别值得仔细考虑。这可能很棒——我做了三年，结果成长了很多——但也很容易失败。一些重要的问题需要问自己:
>
>- 我有没有非常想花一年时间去探索或努力的事情？
>- 我是否有办法养活自己，让我有时间和精力成长？
>- 我真的能一次连续几个月独立工作吗？我有没有在个人项目上努力工作或者在没有外部结构的情况下学习的例子？
>- 我是否拥有或者可以学习独立完成这个项目所需的技能？
>- 对于我想做的事情，我有社区、同伴支持或指导的来源吗？





Some of these questions are tempting to just say yes to without engaging: “*Of course* I can work self-directed without structure.” But these are actually difficult things, and switching to having no structure is jumping into the deep end. Many of the people I’ve seen successfully work independently in their late teens / early twenties had a history of independent study or projects before doing so. For example, many Thiel Fellows had either self studied to the point where they were they largely knew the undergraduate curriculum in some topic, or had significant applied expertise in programming.

Doing an internship, residency, or startup can be easier -- at least in some regards -- than working independently. There’s more structure (especially in the first two) and a clearer path to supporting yourself. For these, I would mostly focus on how valuable you think the experience will be. Do you feel like you’ll learn? Does it feel like a good community? Does it feel important? If it feels urgent, is the urgency for good reasons?

## Not Having a Degree

原文：

It’s important to be aware that not having a degree can have several negative long-term consequences.

University degrees have a lot of signaling and credentialing value. They cheaply communicate to other individuals and organizations that you have some baseline skills, at least in theory. In some fields, you can succeed without a degree by demonstrating skill in other ways (publications, open source projects, **portfolios**, talks, awards, work history, **referrals**, etc). Other fields are less accepting. How can you tell which type of field you're in? One useful test can be to look for examples of people who are successful without degrees in your field. Even if your field is very good about this, you may wish to move into another field at some later point and run into challenges where your previous successes aren’t **legible** to the new field, or the new field is more credential focused.

原文：

Unfortunately, traditional credentials may be more important for **demographics** than others. As a white male, I suspect that it's easier for me to be taken seriously without a degree that it would be for others. If you are part of a group that society is less likely to perceive as skilled by default, it may be harder to do without the validation of a degree. This is obviously really unfair, but I don't feel qualified to give advice on it or comment on how big an issue it is.

There's also a weird **flip side** to all these downsides. Once you establish yourself as competent there is this kind of **threshold effect** where not having a university degree can suddenly start causing people to actually take you more seriously. This kind of countersignalling effect seems to be common when you do non-traditional things.

In addition to the direct career consequences, not having a degree can be a source of major immigration challenges. The version of this I’ve seen most often is people wanting to move to the US (usually the Bay Area) but being **ineligible** for most visas due to the lack of a degree. If you think you may have this problem, try to do a short consultation with an immigration lawyer early: there may be things you can do to start building a case. (For those immigrating to the US, the solution to this is usually to get an “alien of extraordinary ability” O-1 visa, which doesn’t require a degree but does require a lot of evidence of your accomplishments.)

## Family Challenges

原文：

Unfortunately, even if you feel confident that you would be best served by taking a non-traditional path, many young people face significant social and emotional barriers to doing so, particularly from adults. While some people are lucky enough to have a family that will support them doing something unusual, many are not. This can manifest in ways ranging from gentle skepticism, to lack of support, all the way up to **coercive** measures. It can also involve hurtful accusations or gossiping (eg. someone isn’t going to university because they’re lazy or failed).

学习：


>**Coercive** 是一个形容词，意思是“胁迫的，强制的，迫使的”。它描述一种通过威胁、施压或其他强制手段来影响或控制他人行为的方式。与“persuasive”（劝说的）相对，**coercive** 通常带有负面的含义，强调强迫性和缺乏选择的自由。
>
>------
>
>**中英文例句**
>
>1. "The government implemented coercive measures to enforce the lockdown."
>   **政府实施了强制措施来执行封锁政策。**
>2. "She felt trapped in a coercive relationship where she had no say in important decisions."
>   **她感到被困在一个受胁迫的关系中，无法在重要决策中发表意见。**
>3. "Using coercive tactics to make someone agree is unethical and often counterproductive."
>   **使用胁迫手段让某人同意是不道德的，通常也是适得其反的。**
>
>------
>
>**结合上下文解释**
>
>在文中，**coercive measures** 是指成年人（如家人或社会）通过胁迫或强制手段干涉年轻人选择非传统路径的行为。这可能表现为强迫他们接受特定的教育选择（例如去上大学），或者通过威胁剥夺经济支持等手段来施加压力。
>
>例如：
>
>- 家长可能威胁停止资助孩子的生活费，迫使他们选择去大学。
>- 社会舆论可能施加压力，使年轻人不得不遵从传统路径。

原文：

Skepticism or lack of support from family often comes from a good place. People around you are, naturally, worried about what will happen to you if you do something unusual. They may also face other pressures. For example, they may worry that their peers will think they are being irresponsible by “allowing” their child to do this. They may even worry how it will influence legal proceedings like a divorce, if such a thing is relevant. It can feel especially hurtful when these other pressures are clearly major factors. It’s a difficult and emotionally stressful situation on both sides.



The situation is often complicated by deeply asymmetric power dynamics. Depending on the situation, your parents may have direct legal power, you may depend on them for financial support, you may depend on them for housing, and even if you are self-sufficient they may have legal control of your assets. They also have, independent of their hard power, a great deal of emotional power from the role and authority they’ve exercised throughout your life. This can make the situation scary, volatile, and in some cases potentially dangerous for you.

学习：
>
>
>Power dynamics指的是在人际关系中，特别是在家庭关系中，不同个体之间存在的权力差异和相互作用。这种权力差异可以是实际的权力，例如法律上的控制权、经济支持或住房提供，也可以是情感上的权力，即由于一个人在另一个人生活中长期扮演的角色和行使的权威而产生的影响力。 
>
>中英文例句 
>
>- "The power dynamics in the workplace can affect team morale and productivity."  工作场所中的权力动态可能会影响团队的士气和生产力。 
>- - "In a healthy relationship, power dynamics are balanced and respectful."  在健康的关系中，权力动态是平衡和相互尊重的。 
>- - "Understanding the power dynamics within a family can help resolve conflicts more effectively."  了解家庭内部的权力动态有助于更有效地解决冲突。 
>
>Power dynamics 在上下文中的含义： 
>
>在这个上下文中，power dynamics指的是家庭成员之间存在的不对等权力关系。父母可能拥有法律上的直接权力、经济上的支持能力、住房的提供能力，甚至在子女自给自足的情况下，仍可能对子女的资产拥有法律控制权。此外，父母还拥有情感上的权力，这种权力来源于他们一生中所扮演的角色和行使的权威。这些权力动态可能会使情况变得复杂、令人恐惧、不稳定，甚至在某些情况下对个人构成潜在的危险。

The most common resolution I’ve seen or heard of is external validation: someone gets a Thiel Fellowship, or their startup gets funded, etc, and people around them become much more supportive. This can be a somewhat disappointing resolution for the “validated” party (“why couldn’t they believe in me before I was endorsed?”). It may help to try and picture things from the perspective of someone who is scared for you and doesn’t understand the situation very well.

In many cases, communicating with your family may be helpful. There’s a lot of general advice on how to have difficult conversations (non-violent communication, difficult conversations, etc.) that might be useful in having an effective conversation. There's also more specific advice on how to have particular kinds of difficult conversations with your parents (eg. telling them that you're gay, or an **atheist**, or other things they may not respond to well) that may have some **transferable** advice. Unfortunately, there are also cases where communicating might make things worse, because of the asymmetric power adults may have over you.

atheist：美 [ˈeɪθiɪst] 无神论者



>这里的“transferable”意思是“可转移的”或“可迁移的”。在原文中的意思是，针对特定类型的困难对话（如向父母出柜、告知他们自己是无神论者等）的一些建议或策略，可以被应用或迁移到其他类似的困难对话情境中去。 
>
>中文例句： 他在处理客户投诉时积累的经验是可转移的，可以帮助他更好地解决与供应商之间的纠纷。 
>
>英文例句： The experience he gained in handling customer complaints is transferable, helping him better resolve disputes with suppliers.



原文：

While it won’t solve the fundamental issues, it can be extremely emotionally helpful to have an aligned support network. Having people who were proud of me for good reasons and could recognize my successes and failures was deeply affirming and motivating for me. This is something you can deliberately build by seeking out people who share your interests and values.



(In truly extreme cases, such as abusive families, there may be ways to get support from a family court, get yourself **emancipated** or have your **custody** transferred. There may be softer courses of action, like living with family or friends for a bit without legal action. These are extreme courses of action that may sometimes be the best of many terrible options in rare cases. I've also heard stories where they made things worse. I don't feel qualified to give advice on this; if you are considering it, please seek specialized advice and be careful. You may be able to go to a legal clinic or get a **pro-bono** consultation with a family lawyer. You may wish to confirm **confidentiality** rules before speaking, in case they are different for someone underage. There may be specialized non-profits in your area that can give you advice, hotlines, or useful resources online. I am not the right person to ask for advice on this.)
