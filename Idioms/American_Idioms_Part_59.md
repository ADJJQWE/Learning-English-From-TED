The origin of this idiom is not definitive, but it generally means giving everything you have or using all available resources. One popular explanation is that during World War II, the length of the ammunition belts for aircraft machine guns was nine yards, and when pilots used all their ammunition, they had given it everything they had.

## 1164. There’s a method to his madness

“他看似疯狂，实际上有其道理” 或 “外表疯狂，实则有理”。

这个短语源自威廉·莎士比亚的戏剧 《哈姆雷特》（Hamlet）。在剧中，波洛涅斯（Polonius）观察哈姆雷特（Hamlet）的一些行为后说出这句台词，暗示尽管哈姆雷特表现得疯狂，但他所为实际上有其目的和逻辑。在现代用法中，这个短语通常用来指某人看似无序或荒谬的行为，但实际上背后有着精心安排或合理的理由。

This phrase originates from William Shakespeare’s play “Hamlet.” In the play, Polonius observes some of Hamlet’s actions and comments with this phrase, suggesting that despite appearing mad, Hamlet’s actions are purposeful and logical. In modern usage, the idiom generally refers to someone whose actions seem chaotic or absurd but actually have a well-thought-out rationale behind them.

## 1165. There’s no such thing as a free lunch

“天下没有免费的午餐” 。

这个短语起源于 20 世纪初，当时一些酒吧会提供免费的午餐以吸引顾客，但条件是他们必须买饮料。实际上，这些饮料的价格已经涵盖了午餐的成本。因此，这个表达告诉我们，世上没有真正的免费，即使看似免费的东西，往往隐藏着某种代价或附带条件。

This phrase originated in the early 20th century when some bars would offer a “*free lunch*” to attract patrons, but only if they bought drinks. In reality, the cost of the lunch was covered by the inflated price of the drinks. Hence, the expression conveys that nothing comes for free, and that seemingly free items often have hidden costs or conditions.

- Remember, *there’s no such thing as a free lunch*; everything has a cost.记住，天下没有免费的午餐；一切皆有代价。

- The promotional offer looks good, but *there’s no such thing as a free lunch*.这个促销看起来挺棒，但天下没有免费的午餐。

“他们被匆忙地凑到一起” 或 “他们被仓促地安排在一起”。

这个短语起源于突发事件或紧急情况，需要快速组成一个团队或将一群人安排在一起。通常，这种情况下的人们并不熟悉对方，可能来自不同的背景或有不同的技能，但因为特定的任务或环境，他们不得不一起合作。

This phrase originates from situations where, due to sudden events or emergencies, people are rapidly assembled into a team or placed together. In these scenarios, individuals usually do not know each other well, and might come from different backgrounds or possess different skills, but they must collaborate because of a specific task or environment.

跳出框框思考；打破常规思考。

这个短语起源于 20 世纪 70 年代，用于鼓励人们在遇到问题时避免固有的思维模式，而是用新颖、创造性的方式去解决问题。后来，这句话被广泛应用于商业和创新领域，成为鼓励创新和创造性思维的口号。

## 1168. Third time’s a charm

“三次定律” 或 “第三次会有好运”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到古老的英国，表达的是在第三次尝试通常会获得成功的观念。这种观念认为前两次尝试可能会因为各种原因失败，但第三次通常会有好运相伴，进而成功。因此，在遇到困难或失败后，鼓励继续尝试的语境中常会使用这个短语。

This phrase traces its origins back to ancient British culture, expressing the notion that success usually comes on the third try. This idea suggests that while the first two attempts might fail due to various reasons, the third attempt is often accompanied by good luck, leading to success. Hence, it is commonly used in contexts where persistence and continued effort after failure are encouraged.

- Don’t worry if you didn’t pass the exam this time. Remember, *third time’s a charm*.不要担心这次没通过考试。记住，第三次会有好运的。

## 1170. Those who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones

“住在玻璃房子里的人不应该扔石头”，意思是人不要对别人进行批评，特别是当自己也有类似缺点或问题时。

这个短语源自古老的谚语，旨在提醒人们要谨慎对待对他人的批评和指责，因为自身可能也存在类似的缺点或易受攻击之处。这种表达常用于提醒人们在批评他人之前要先检讨自己。

The phrase originates from an old proverb that serves to remind people to be cautious in criticizing or judging others, especially when they themselves may have similar flaws or vulnerabilities. It is often used to remind people to look at their own shortcomings before criticizing others.

## 1171. Three sheets to the wind

“喝得酩酊大醉” 或 “烂醉如泥”。

这个短语起源于 18 世纪英国航海术语。在航海中，“*sheet*” 并不是指床单，而是操控帆的绳索。当三条绳索都松开时，船容易失控，摇摆不定，通俗来说就是东倒西歪。因此，形容一个人醉酒得控制不住自己，就像失控的船一样。

This phrase originates from 18th-century British nautical terminology. In sailing, a “*sheet*” does not refer to a bedsheet but to a rope that controls the sail. When three sheets are loose, the ship is hard to control and sways back and forth, much like a person who is heavily intoxicated and unsteady.

- He came home *three sheets to the wind* after the party.他在聚会后喝得烂醉如泥回了家。

## 1172. Threw me for a loop

“让我大吃一惊” 或 “让我措手不及”。

这个短语源自拳击和西方口语中，“*loop*”指的是一个环绕或旋转的动作。当某人的预期被剧烈地颠覆，或者发生了令人惊讶的事情，他们就有了被 “环绕” 或 “旋转” 的感觉。因此，“*threw me for a loop*” 表示让一个人感到非常意外和措手不及的情况。

This idiom originates from boxing and Western colloquial expressions, where “*loop*” refers to a circling or spinning motion. When someone’s expectations are drastically overturned or something surprising happens, they feel like they’ve been “*spun*” or “*looped*”. Therefore, “threw me for a loop” signifies a situation where someone is greatly surprised or caught off guard.

- The sudden resignation of our manager *threw me for a loop*.我们经理的突然辞职让我大吃一惊。

- His unexpected confession really *threw me for a loop*.他意外的告白让我措手不及。

This phrase originates from medieval England, where it referred to the dense (*thick*) and sparse (*thin*) parts of a forest, signifying that one will go through any difficulties or favorable circumstances together.

这个短语源自棒球运动中的曲线球（curveball），这种球的轨迹难以预测，会让击球手措手不及。在日常生活中，“throw a curveball” 用来形容某人给别人出难题或制造意外的状况，使人措手不及或打乱计划。

This phrase originates from baseball, where a curveball has an unpredictable trajectory that can catch the batter off guard. In everyday life, “*throw a curveball*” describes a situation where someone presents an unexpected problem or surprise that disrupts plans or catches others unprepared.

“搅局” 或 “破坏计划”。

这个短语起源于美国工业历史中的一个真实工具，即 “猴子扳手（monkey wrench）”。如果把这个工具扔进运转的机器里，势必会导致机器停工或损坏。因此，这个表达逐渐演变为比喻任何故意或无意中破坏已经计划好或正在进行的事情的行为。

This phrase originates from a real tool in American industrial history, the “monkey wrench.” If the tool was thrown into a working machine, it would cause the machine to stop or be damaged.

This phrase first appeared in the 19th century, indicating a person is ready to abandon caution and take some risks or bold actions.

This idiom originates from ancient tales or stories where a person thrown to the wolves is placed in extreme danger or abandoned in a hostile and harsh environment, forced to face all challenges and threats alone.

tickle：痒；发痒；痒感；

“非常高兴” 或 “乐得合不拢嘴”。

这个短语的来历并无确切的出处，但可以追溯到 20 世纪早期。词源学家推测该表达法源于当人们非常开心或受宠若惊时，脸上会泛起一种红晕，这种颜色与粉色相似，因此得名 “*tickled pink*”。这个表达法常用于描述极其愉快、非常开心的情感状态。

This idiom doesn’t have a precise origin but can be traced back to the early 20th century. Etymologists suggest that the expression comes from the idea that when people are very happy or delighted, their faces might develop a pinkish blush, hence “tickled pink.” It is used to describe an extreme state of happiness or delight.

This phrase originates from periods of economic hardship when people had to cut down on food to save money, leading them to tighten their belts as they lost weight.

“与风车作斗争” 或 “庸人自扰”。

这个短语源自米格尔·德·塞万提斯撰写的小说《堂吉诃德》。在小说中，堂吉诃德将风车误认为巨人，并向它们发起攻击，最终徒劳无功。这个短语用来形容那些攻击或对抗想象中的敌人或毫无意义的目标，通常表示一种浪费精力的愚蠢行为。

This idiom originates from Miguel de Cervantes’ novel “Don Quixote.” In the novel, Don Quixote mistakes windmills for giants and attacks them, resulting in a futile effort. The phrase is used to describe a situation where someone is attacking imaginary enemies or pursuing a vain and futile course of action, signifying a waste of energy on pointless endeavors.
