This phrase originates from the age of sailing ships when cannons were fixed on deck.

Therefore, “*loose cannon*” is used to describe someone who is unpredictable and potentially dangerous.

This phrase originates from its literal meaning, namely losing direct contact with someone.

这个短语来源于黄蜂（hornet）的行为特征。黄蜂是一种攻击性很强的昆虫，当它们受惊或被激怒时会非常狂暴和具有威胁性。因而，“mad as a hornet” 用来形容一个人非常愤怒，像被激怒的黄蜂一样愤怒和不可理喻。

This idiom originates from a physiological reaction known as piloerection or the “*goosebumps*” effect, which occurs when someone feels extreme fear or shock, causing the tiny muscles at the base of hairs to contract and the hairs to stand upright.

This phrase originates from the behavior of bees. When bees find nectar, they will fly straight back to the hive to share the food they found with other bees. Thus, the phrase is used to describe someone moving quickly and directly towards a target, just like bees without detours.
