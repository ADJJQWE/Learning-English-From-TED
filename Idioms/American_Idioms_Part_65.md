## 1292. Washing my hands of something/someone

这个短语起源于《圣经》中彼拉多的故事。彼拉多是罗马总督，他在耶稣被审判时，象征性地洗了手，以表示自己对于耶稣的命运不再负责。这一动作象征着他想从此事中撇清关系，因此短语 “washing my hands of something/someone” 逐渐演变成了表示不再涉及或脱身某事／某人的意思。

The phrase “washing my hands of something/someone” comes from a story in the Bible about Pontius Pilate. Pilate was a Roman governor who, during the trial of Jesus, symbolically washed his hands to show that he was no longer responsible for Jesus' fate.
