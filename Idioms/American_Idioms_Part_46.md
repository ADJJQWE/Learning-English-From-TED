frying pan：（长柄平底）煎锅；平底锅；炸锅          

“跳出油锅，又入火坑”，表示从一个困境又掉入另一个更糟糕的困境。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到古代的谚语和故事，其中一个典型的版本来自于《伊索寓言》。在寓言故事中，一只小鱼为了逃脱煎锅的热油而跳出，结果掉进了火里，境遇更加危险。这个短语用来形容一个人从一个困境中解脱出来，却不幸地陷入了另一个更糟糕的困境。

This phrase originates from ancient proverbs and stories, with a notable example from Aesop’s Fables. In the fable, a small fish jumps out of the frying pan to escape the hot oil, only to land in the fire, making its situation worse. This idiom is used to describe someone who escapes one predicament only to find themselves in an even worse situation.

This phrase dates back to ancient Europe, where traversing woods was often dangerous and uncertain. When people said they were “out of the woods,” it meant they had traversed a dangerous area and reached a relatively safer place.

The phrase “*pass the buck*” can be traced back to 19th-century American poker games. When it was a player’s turn to deal, they would be given a marker known as a “buck,” often made from a knife handle.

这个短语起源于 18 世纪左右，其中 “penny（便士）” 是英国的最基本的货币单位。短语中的 “*pretty*” 并不是指 “漂亮”，而是强调数量多，意思上跟 “相当多的钱” 类似。所以 “pay a pretty penny” 意指支付一笔相当昂贵的费用。

This phrase originated around the 18th century, with “*penny*” being the basic unit of currency in Britain. In this context, “*pretty*” doesn’t mean “*beautiful*”, but rather it emphasizes a large amount. So “pay a pretty penny” means to pay a quite expensive amount.

This idiom first appeared in the 20th century and is often used to describe the high cost of something, to the extent that it feels like losing an arm and a leg.

“为自己的行为承担后果” 或 “付出代价”。

这个短语源自一个古老的故事，描述了一个城镇为了摆脱鼠患，雇佣了一个伐木笛手来引诱老鼠离开，但最终拒绝支付约定的报酬。伐木笛手因此通过诱惑城镇的孩子们离开，以此作为报复教训。这个短语也体现了一个古老的教训：不兑现承诺或避开责任最终会付出更大代价。

This idiom originates from an old story about a town that hired a piper to rid it of rats but then refused to pay the piper as promised. The piper retaliated by luring the town’s children away.

这个短语的起源有多种说法，其中一种说法是其来源于 9 世纪的爱尔兰，当时丹麦人对付当地人的税收非常高昂，如果有人不缴税，就会被割掉鼻子。另一种说法是此短语源于 17 世纪的英国，意思是支付过高的价格。无论其具体来源如何，现今该短语常用于描述为了某物支付了过高的价格或不合理的费用。

This phrase has several origin stories. One story is that it came from 9th century Ireland when the Danes imposed very high taxes on the locals, and if someone didn’t pay, their noses would be slit. Another story suggests it originated in 17th century England to mean paying an exorbitant price.
