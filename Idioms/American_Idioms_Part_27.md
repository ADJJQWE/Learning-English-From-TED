## 521. Go off the deep end

“失去冷静” 或 “失去理智”。这个短语指一个人在情绪上突然崩溃或变得非常生气，通常表现出非理性的行为。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到游泳池的深水区。游泳池通常有浅水区和深水区，浅水区较安全，而深水区则需要更高的游泳技能。一个人如果没有准备就跳入深水区，可能会感到慌乱和失控，借此比喻人情绪上的失控。

This phrase can be traced back to swimming pools, which usually have a shallow end and a deep end. The shallow end is safer, while the deep end requires higher swimming skills. If someone jumps into the deep end unprepared, they might feel panicked and out of control, which is used here as a metaphor for emotional breakdown.

- When he heard the bad news, he just *went off the deep end* and started shouting.当他听到坏消息时，他简直失去了理智，开始大喊大叫。

- Don’t *go off the deep end*. Let’s figure this out calmly.别失去冷静，我们冷静地解决这个问题。

## 522. Go on a wild goose chase

goose：美 [ɡuːs] 鹅；鹅肉

geese：美 [ɡiːs] 鹅 （goose的复数）

“徒劳无功的追寻” 或 “白费功夫的寻找”。

这个短语最早起源于 16 世纪的英国文学，意指追赶野生鹅是徒劳无功的，因为它们飞行的方向变化无常且不可预测。因此，这个短语被用来形容那些耗费时间和精力却没有任何结果的行动。

This phrase originally comes from 16th-century English literature, signifying that chasing wild geese is futile because of their unpredictable flight patterns. As a result, it describes actions that waste time and effort without any fruitful outcome.

- We went on a wild goose chase trying to find that old book.我们白费功夫地寻找那本旧书。

- She sent me on a wild goose chase looking for that nonexistent restaurant.她让我费尽心力去找那不存在的餐馆。

- Following that clue turned out to be a wild goose chase.追寻那个线索结果是徒劳无功的。

## 523. Go out of one’s way

“不遗余力” 或 “竭尽全力”。

这个短语起源于古英语中 “*way*” 代表道路或途径，而 “go out of one’s way” 则表示脱离正常路径去完成某事。它意味着为了达成目标或者帮助别人，做出超出常规的努力和牺牲。

This phrase originates from Old English where “\*way\*” means road or path, and “go out of one’s way” refers to stepping off the normal path to accomplish something. It signifies making extra effort and sacrifice in order to achieve a goal or help someone.

- She really *went out of her way* to make sure everyone felt comfortable at the party.她真的竭尽全力确保每个人在聚会上都感到舒服。

## 524. Go out on a limb

limb：美 [lɪm]分支；枝条；边缘部分

“冒险做某事” 或 “承担风险”。

这个短语源自于爬树时站在一根树枝上，站在树枝的末端会更加不稳定和危险。在现代社会，该短语用来形容一个人愿意冒风险或承担责任去做某事，通常是在给予某种支持或意见时。

This idiom originates from the idea of climbing a tree and standing on a limb (*a branch*), where the further out you go the less stable and more risky it becomes. In modern usage, “*go out on a limb*” means to take a risk or put oneself in a vulnerable position for a particular purpose, often to offer support or give an opinion.

- I’m going to *go out on a limb* and say that our team will win the championship this year.我要冒险说一句，我们的球队今年会赢得冠军。

overboard：从船上落水；向舷外；过分；极端；彻底

“做得过火” 或 “过度热情”。

这个短语来自航海术语，指的是人从船上掉进水中。比喻的意思是指某人做事情太过分或表现得过于极端，在行为和情绪上超越了合理的限度。

This phrase originates from nautical terminology, meaning someone falls over the side of a boat into the water. Figuratively, it means to do something excessively or to get carried away beyond reasonable limits in both actions and emotions.

- Don’t *go overboard* with the decorations; we want a simple look.不要把装饰弄得太夸张了；我们想要简洁的样子。

## 526. Go postal

“发疯” 或 “暴怒”。

这个短语起源于 20 世纪 80 年代美国邮政服务的员工由于过度压力而发生的几起暴力事件。当时几名邮局员工在工作场所大开 杀 戒，引发了极大的社会关注。尽管这一现象并非普遍，但从此 “*go postal*” 就成为了描述某人突然暴怒或失控行为的表达。

This phrase originated in the 1980s in the United States following several instances where postal workers committed acts of workplace violence due to excessive stress. Although such incidents were not widespread, “*go postal*” has since become an expression used to describe someone suddenly going into a violent rage or losing control.

- When traffic is this bad, I feel like I’m about to *go postal*.当交通如此糟糕时，我感觉我快要发疯了。

- He went postal when he found out they had crashed his car.当他发现他们撞了他的车时，他暴怒了。

## 527. Go south

“情况变糟” 或 “事态恶化”。

这个短语来源于地理方向，主要是指朝南走。在地图上，南方通常在下方，隐喻着下降和负面变化。在英语中，“go south” 常用来形容情况突然变坏或者事情失控，类似于中文的 “走下坡路” 或 “每况愈下” 的意思。

This phrase comes from the geographical direction, mainly referring to moving south. On a map, south is usually towards the bottom, which metaphorically represents decline or negative changes. In English, “go south” is often used to describe a situation that suddenly deteriorates or becomes uncontrollable, similar to the Chinese expressions “走下坡路” or “每况愈下”.

## 528. Go the extra mile

“多做一点” 或 “加倍努力”。

这个短语源自《新约圣经》中《马太福音》第五章 41 节，其中耶稣提到 “有人强逼你走一里路，你就同他走二里”。这句话的意思是，当你被要求完成一些事情时，应该多做一点，多付出一些努力。现在，这个习语常用于表示人们不满足于完成最基本的任务，而是愿意付出额外的努力来达到更高的目标或提供更好的服务。

This phrase originates from the New Testament in the Bible, specifically Matthew 5:41, where Jesus said, “If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.” The meaning behind this is that when you are asked to do something, you should put in extra effort. Today, the idiom is used to describe people who are willing to go beyond the minimum requirement to achieve higher goals or provide better service.

- She always goes the extra mile to help her students succeed.她总是加倍努力帮助她的学生取得成功。

## 529. Go the whole hog

hog：美 [hɔːɡ]（尤指喂肥供食用的）猪；家养猪；

“全力以赴” 或 “一鼓作气”。

这个短语起源于十九世纪的英国，指的是在某种活动或情境中投入最大的努力，尤其是毫不犹豫地完成整个过程（例如吃掉整只猪）。随着时间的推移，这个表达变得更为广泛，适用于各种追求和决策场合，意指全心全意地完成某事，而不是半途而废。

This phrase originates from 19th-century Britain, referring to making the maximum effort in an activity or situation, especially completing the whole process without hesitation, such as eating an entire hog. Over time, this expression has become more general, applying to various pursuits and decisions, meaning to commit fully to something rather than doing it halfway.

## 530. Go through it with a fine-tooth comb

comb：美 [koʊm] 梳子；梳发工具 **注意发音**

fine-tooth：细齿

“仔细检查” 或 “一丝不苟地检查”。

这个短语起源于使用细齿梳子来梳理头发，目的是捕捉头发中的细小物体或结。这种梳子可以捕捉到头发中非常小的东西，因此这个短语就用来表示非常仔细的检查或审查。

This phrase originates from using a fine-tooth comb to groom hair, intending to catch small objects or tangles in the hair. Such combs can capture very small items in the hair, so the phrase has come to mean conducting a very thorough examination or review.

## 531. Go to hell in a handbasket

“迅速恶化” 或 “走向毁灭”。

这个短语的起源并不完全明确，有些研究者认为它源自 18 世纪美国的煤矿工人，他们会用手提篮将煤炭运送到地表，而有时这些篮子会直接掉入深坑。另一些解释则认为这个短语起源于旧时传说中，被用篮子送去地狱的人。这两种说法都体现了快速而不可阻挡的下滑和灾难。

The exact origin of this phrase is not entirely clear. Some researchers believe it derives from the 18th-century American coal miners who would transport coal in baskets to the surface, and sometimes these baskets would fall into deep pits. Others suggest it comes from folklore about being carried to hell in a basket. Both interpretations convey a rapid and uncontrollable descent into disaster.

The origin of the phrase is not entirely clear, but it is commonly believed to come from places where, in bad economic or social conditions, people might throw discarded food and useless items to the dogs. “*Go to the dogs*” means something deteriorates from a good state to a bad one, losing its value like discarded food.

“化为乌有” 或 “化为烟雾”。这个短语用来形容计划、希望、努力等突然间失败，或者一切都白费，一切变得徒劳无功。

这个短语的起源与火焰有关。物体着火，会变成烟雾消失殆尽，象征着某种实际存在的东西彻底消失。因此, “*go up in smoke*” 就表示某种期望或者计划突然完全消失，就像烟雾一样。

This phrase has its origins in fire. When an object catches fire, it turns into smoke and vanishes completely, symbolizing something that was tangible but has now disappeared. Thus, “*go up in smoke*” signifies that a hope, plan, or effort has suddenly and completely vanished, just like smoke.
