## 381. Every now and then

“时不时” 或 “偶尔”。

这个短语出现于 16 世纪，表达的是一种不定期但会重复发生的事情。“Every now and then” 用来描述那些偶尔会发生或被做的事，但不是很规律性的。

This phrase originated in the 16th century and describes something that happens or is done occasionally and not regularly. “Every now and then” captures the notion of irregular but repeated occurrences.

- I like to take a walk *every now and then* to clear my mind.我喜欢时不时地散散步来清理一下思绪。

- *Every now and then*, we go out for dinner instead of cooking at home.我们偶尔会出去吃饭，而不是在家做饭。

- He calls his parents *every now and then* to check on them.他时不时地打电话给父母，看看他们情况如何。

## 382. Everything but the kitchen sink

“什么都有了，除了厨房水槽” 或 “应有尽有”。

这个短语起源于 20 世纪初。当人们要描述带走了所有能带的东西，只剩下嵌墙里的厨房水槽无法拆走时，就会用这个短语。如今，这个短语用来形容一个地方或某个情境中什么都有，丰富得无所不包。

This phrase originated in the early 20th century. When people wanted to describe taking everything but the kitchen sink which can’t be removed as it is affixed to the wall, they used this phrase. Nowadays, it is used to describe a place or situation that has everything one could possibly need or imagine, being all-inclusive.

- They packed *everything but the kitchen sink* for their camping trip.他们为露营旅行打包了应有尽有的东西。

- Her purse contained *everything but the kitchen sink*.她的手提包里什么都有。

- When they remodeled the house, they added *everything but the kitchen sink* in the new design.他们装修房子时，在新设计里几乎包括了所有能想到的东西。

## 383. Exact change

“正好” 或 “正好找零”。

这个短语常用于指在支付时恰好提供了正确的金额，而不需要找零。在日常购物中，特别是在使用现金支付时，这是一个经常出现的情况。

This phrase is commonly used to indicate that the exact amount of money needed for a transaction has been provided, so no change is required. It frequently occurs in everyday shopping, especially when paying with cash.

- Do you have exact change for the bus fare?你有正好的公交车费吗？

- I always keep some coins in my pocket for exact change.我总是在口袋里放些硬币以备正好找零。

- The cashier asked if I had exact change for my purchase.收银员问我有没有正好找零的金额。

## 384. Excuse my French/Pardon my French

“原谅我说脏话” 或 “请原谅我的不雅语言”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到 19 世纪。当时，英国人有时会插入法语单词或短语来显得自己更有学识。然而，听众不一定懂法语，所以说话者会道歉说 “Excuse my French”，意思是对那些不懂法语的人表达歉意。随着时间的流逝，这个短语的含义逐渐转变，用来在说出不雅言辞之前或之后道歉，即表示对粗俗语言的歉意。

This phrase can be traced back to the 19th century when English speakers would sometimes insert French words or phrases to appear more educated. However, the audience might not understand French, so the speaker would apologize by saying “*Excuse my French*” to excuse themselves for using a foreign language. Over time, the phrase evolved to apologize for using profane language, indicating an excuse for the use of cuss words or vulgarity.

- This project is a real pain in the… *pardon my French*.这个项目真的是一个大麻烦……请原谅我的措辞。

- That movie was so boring, it was a total waste of time. *Excuse my French*.那部电影太无聊了，完全是浪费时间。请原谅我的措辞。

- He’s such a… *pardon my French*, jerk.他真是个……请原谅我的措辞，混蛋。

## 385. Face the music

“面对现实” 或 “接受后果”。

这个短语的起源不完全明确，但有两个主要的猜测。第一个是与传统军队中的阅兵有关，士兵需要在音乐的伴奏下坦然面对自己的命运。另一个猜测则与戏剧舞台表演有关，演员在面对观众表演时，要直面现场的掌声或嘘声。因此，“face the music” 意味着勇敢地面对困难或责任，无论好坏。

This idiom’s origin is not entirely clear, but there are two main theories. The first one relates to the military tradition where soldiers had to face their fate in a ceremony accompanied by music. The second theory is linked to theatrical performances, where actors had to face the audience’s applause or boos. Therefore, “*face the music*” means to bravely confront difficulties or take responsibility, regardless of the outcome.

- After avoiding his responsibilities for months, John finally had to *face the music* and confess his mistakes.在逃避责任几个月后，约翰终于不得不面对现实，承认自己的错误。

- The company had to *face the music* after their product caused a safety issue.在他们的产品引发安全问题后，公司不得不面对现实。

## 386. Fair and square

“光明正大” 或 “公平公正”。

这个短语起源于 15 到 16 世纪，当时用 “*square*” 来形容一个人的性格正直、无偏见。结合 “*fair*”（公平的）这个词，“fair and square” 用于强调事情或行为的公正、正直和透明，毫无争议或偏私之嫌。

This phrase originates from the 15th to 16th centuries when “*square*” was used to describe someone’s character as honest and unbiased. Combined with the term “fair,” “*fair and square*” is used to emphasize that something or someone’s actions are just, upright, and transparent, without any dispute or partiality.

- He won the competition *fair and square*.他光明正大地赢得了比赛。

- Let’s settle this argument *fair and square*.让我们光明正大地解决这个争论。

- She got the job *fair and square*, without any favoritism.她在没有任何偏袒的情况下光明正大地得到了这份工作。

## 387. Fair to middling

“还过得去” 或 “普普通通”。

这个短语源于 19 世纪的农业，在当时 “*fair*” 表示作物的质量尚可，而 “*middling*” 表示质量中等。这两个词结合起来，用以描述事物或情况处于中等、普通水平，并没有特别优秀或糟糕。

This phrase originates from 19th-century agriculture, where “*fair*” indicated crops of decent quality, and “*middling*” referred to a medium quality. Combined, these words came to describe something that is average or moderate, neither particularly good nor bad.

- How’s your day been? “Fair to middling,” I guess.你的今天过得怎么样？还过得去吧，我想。

- The meal was fair to middling, nothing special.这顿饭还过得去，没有什么特别的。

- His performance was fair to middling; not his best work.他的表现普普通通，不是他最好的作品。

## 388. Fair-weather friend

“酒肉朋友” 或 “只能同享乐不能共患难的朋友”。

这个短语的来历可以追溯到 16 世纪。当时，“*fair weather*” 指的是好天气，因而 “fair-weather friend” 意味着只在好天气时陪伴你的人，暗指那些只在你处于顺境时才是你朋友的人。在现代英语中，这个短语形象地比喻了那些在你顺境时对你热情，而在你困境时远离你的朋友。

The origin of this idiom can be traced back to the 16th century. At that time, “*fair weather*” referred to good weather, so a “fair-weather friend” was someone who was only around you during good times. In modern English, this idiom vividly describes people who are enthusiastic about you when you’re in good times but distance themselves when you’re in trouble.

- I realized he was just a *fair-weather friend* when he wasn’t there for me during hard times.当他在我困难时没有陪伴我，我才意识到他只是一个酒肉朋友。

- She has too many *fair-weather friends* and not enough true friends.她有太多的酒肉朋友，而真正的朋友却不多。

## 389. Fall by the wayside

wayside：路旁；道旁；路边

“半途而废” 或 “被忽视”。

这个成语起源于《圣经》的比喻故事，尤其是撒种的比喻。种子（象征着好意、努力等）落在路边（wayside）时，通常无法生长和繁荣。因此，“fall by the wayside” 表示某事在实现过程中失败或者被人忽视和放弃。

This idiom originates from the parable of the sower in the Bible. Seeds (symbolizing good intentions, efforts, etc.) that fall by the wayside typically do not grow and thrive. Hence, “*fall by the wayside*” means that something fails in the process of being achieved or is neglected and abandoned.

- Many good ideas *fall by the wayside* due to lack of funding.许多好主意因为缺乏资金而半途而废。

- He had big plans for his career, but they all *fell by the wayside*.他对自己的事业有很大的计划，但这些计划都半途而废了。

## 390. Fall off the wagon

wagon：美 [ˈwæɡən] 马车；四轮马车；

“重蹈覆辙” 或 “旧习复发”。

这个短语最初用来指代人们在戒酒后再次开始饮酒。19 世纪末期，美国禁酒运动盛行，参与戒酒的人常说他们 “上了禁酒马车”（on the wagon）。如果他们重新开始饮酒，则被称为 “从马车上掉下来”（fall off the wagon）。现在，这个短语可以用于描述任何人再度陷入曾经戒过的恶习或坏习惯。

This phrase originally referred to people who, after quitting alcohol, start drinking again. In the late 19th century, America saw a temperance movement, and those who joined the temperance pledge would say they were “*on the wagon*”. If they resumed drinking, it was termed “*fall off the wagon*”. Nowadays, this idiom can be used to describe anyone falling back into an old habit or vice they had previously quit.

- John was doing well with his diet, but he *fell off the wagon* and started eating junk food again.约翰的饮食控制得很好，但他重蹈覆辙，又开始吃垃圾食品了。

## 391. Fall on deaf ears

“充耳不闻” 或 “未受理会”。

这个短语字面上的意思是说话者的话语被视为无关紧要，传达了但没有被接收或重视。它最早可以追溯到 16 世纪，人们用它来形容那些拒绝听取建议或信息的人。

This phrase literally means that the speaker’s words are considered trivial, delivered but neither received nor valued. It can be traced back to the 16th century and was used to describe people who refuse to heed advice or information.

“熟悉生厌” 或 “亲近变疏”。

这个短语源自于古谚语，意指当我们和某人或某事物过于熟悉时，往往会失去对其的敬重和欣赏之情。该表达的历史可以追溯到古罗马时代，当时就有类似的拉丁语表达：“Familiarity breeds contempt”。在现代，常用于形容那些关系过于密切的人或过度暴露于某环境中的人，开始忽视甚至厌恶对方或环境。

This phrase originates from the fashion world, used to describe those who follow the latest fashion trends blindly without considering their personal circumstances.

“值得骄傲的成就” 或 “荣耀”。

这个短语源于欧洲和美洲的一些传统习俗，在某些文化里，当一个人成功完成某项壮举或表现出卓越的技艺时，会在他的帽子上插一根羽毛以示荣誉。因此，“feather in one’s cap” 被用来表示某人的值得自豪或备受称赞的成就。
