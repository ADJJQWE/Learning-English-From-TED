## 1121. That hit the spot

“正合我意” 或 “正是我想要的”。

这个短语起源于人们吃东西或喝饮料时，如果某种味道或感觉特别满足他们的需求或想法，会用 “*hit the spot*” 来描述那种刚好合适的开心和满足感。在现代社会，这个短语通常用来形容某个东西（尤其是食物和饮料）正好满足了某人的期待和需求。

This phrase originates from the feeling when something you eat or drink particularly satisfies your needs or cravings. Modernly, this idiom is commonly used to describe something (*especially food or drink*) that exactly meets someone’s expectations and needs, providing a sense of satisfaction.

## 1122. That is to say

“也就是说”。

该短语用来进一步解释或重述之前的话，以确保信息清楚明确。例如，当你给出一个复杂的观点后，可以使用 “*That is to say*” 来重新解释，以更简单或直白的方式说出来。在口语和书面语中都很常见。

The phrase is used to further explain or restate what has been said, ensuring clarity and understanding. For example, after providing a complex idea, you might use “*That is to say*” to rephrase it in a simpler or more straightforward way. It is common in both spoken and written language.

- He is a polyglot, *that is to say*, he speaks many languages.他是个多语言者，也就是说，他会说很多种语言。

## 1123. That ship has sailed

“船已经开了” 或 “机不可失时不再来”。

这个短语源自于航海的时代，当一艘船离港后，错过这艘船的人只能等待下一艘。现代社会中，这个表达被用来形容一个机会已经错过，不再可能实现。

This idiom comes from the age of sailing, where once a ship left the port, those who missed it had to wait for the next one. In modern usage, it describes a situation where an opportunity has been missed and is no longer possible.

- He wanted to ask her out, but now she’s dating someone else. *That ship has sailed*.他曾想约她出去，但她现在已经在和别人约会了。机不可失时不再来。

## 1124. That’s all she wrote

“事情就到这里”，或 “事情结束了”。用来表达某件事情已经完全结束或达到了最终结果，没有更多的内容可供补充。

这个短语的起源有多种说法，一种较为普遍的说法是，来源于第二次世界大战期间士兵们从家收到的简单信件，信中只有一句 “That’s all she wrote”（她就写了这些），表示已经没有更多的信息传递给收信人。这句话后来被提炼为一个固定表达，用以形容事情已尘埃落定或没有更多可以谈论的事情。

This phrase has various speculated origins, but a common explanation dates back to World War II. Soldiers would receive short letters from home, and they would say “That’s all she wrote,” indicating that there was no more information in the letter. Over time, this phrase became a fixed expression used to signify that something is completely finished or there is nothing more to discuss.

- After the team lost the final game, *that’s all she wrote.*在队伍输掉最后一场比赛后，事情就到此为止了。

- When he walked out of the room, *that’s all she wrote.*当他走出房间时，事情就算结束了。

## 1125. That’s the last straw

“这是最后一根稻草” 或 “压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草”。

这个短语来源于一句寓言，讲的是一个骆驼被逐渐增加的负担压垮，直到最后一小撮稻草终于使它不堪重负。这个表达常用于形容人在面对持续的压力或问题时，最终一个小问题或事件使人再也无法忍受、承受或妥协。

This phrase originates from a fable about a camel being loaded with increasing amounts of burden until a small straw finally breaks its back. This expression is often used to describe a situation where a person is dealing with continuous pressure or problems, and finally, one small issue or event causes them to no longer bear, endure, or compromise.

## 1126. That’s wicked

“这真是太棒了” 或 “太厉害了”。

“That’s wicked” 是一种俚语，最早起源于英国，后在美国特别是波士顿地区广泛使用。虽然 “*wicked*” 本意是 “邪恶的”，但在这种用法中却表示极好或令人印象深刻，这种用法可能源自青少年亚文化的语言现象，利用反义词创造新的表达方式。

This slang phrase originated in the UK and later became widely used in the US, especially in the Boston area. Although “*wicked*” originally means “evil,” in this context it means extremely good or impressive. This usage perhaps evolved through youth subculture language practices, where antonyms were used to create new expressions.

- That concert was wicked!那场演唱会真是太棒了！

- Wow, your skateboard tricks are wicked!哇，你的滑板技巧真是太厉害了！

## 1127. The apple of my eye

“掌上明珠” 或 “珍爱之人”。

这个短语的起源可以追溯到古英语时期。当时，“*apple*” 这个词用来指瞳孔，因为瞳孔被认为是眼睛中最重要的部分。因此，形容一个人为 “*the apple of my eye*” 意味着这个人对你来说非常重要和珍贵，像是你眼中的瞳孔一样珍视。

This phrase originates from Old English. At that time, the word “*apple*” referred to the pupil of the eye, which was considered the most important part of the eye. Therefore, describing someone as “the apple of my eye” means that the person is very important and precious to you, cherished like the pupil of your eye.

- My daughter is the *apple of my eye*.我的女儿是我的掌上明珠。

- He always talks about his son as if he is the *apple of his eye*.他总是谈论他的儿子，好像他是他的掌上明珠。

## 1128. The ball is in your court

“轮到你做决定” 或 “现在由你负责”。

这个短语起源于网球等球类运动中，当球在某一方球场时，表示该方需要接球并决定下一步的动作。引申到日常生活中，这句话被用来比喻在某个决策或行动过程中，当前的责任或选择权归某人所有。

This idiom originates from sports like tennis, where when the ball is in a player’s court, it’s their responsibility to hit it back and make the next move. In daily life, it is used metaphorically to indicate that the responsibility or decision-making power now lies with a specific person.

- I’ve given you all the information. Now the ball is in your court.我已经给了你所有信息，现在轮到你决定了。

- We made our offer, so the ball is in their court now.我们已经提出了条件，现在轮到他们决定了。

## 1129. The bee’s knees

“最顶尖的” 或 “最好的”。

This phrase originated in American slang in the 1920s and was used to describe anything exceptionally good or of high quality. Its exact origins are unclear, but some researchers suggest that it might just be a nonsense phrase that caught on as a way to humorously describe something outstanding.

## 1131. The best thing since sliced bread

自切片面包以来最好的发明，用来形容某物非常棒或极其优秀。

这个短语起源于 20 世纪初，美国发明家奥托·罗维德于 1928 年发明了切片面包机，这使得面包在市场上更受欢迎和便利。从此，“切片面包” 被视为极大的改进，因此这个短语成了赞美某物非常出色的新创意或新发明的表达方式。

This phrase originated in the early 20th century when American inventor Otto Rohwedder invented the bread-slicing machine in 1928, making bread more popular and convenient. Since then, “*sliced bread*” has been seen as a major improvement, and the phrase has become a way to praise something as an outstanding new idea or invention.

Fitz Gerald, a sports writer for the New York Morning Telegraph, first used it in his horse-racing column to describe New York City as the ultimate goal and glory for horse races.

这个短语的起源尚不完全确定，但普遍认为是在 1970 年代，由记者们在描述新奥尔良的轻松氛围与文化时所使用的。新奥尔良以其独特的音乐、文化、食物和狂欢节（Mardi Gras）著称，所以 “*The Big Easy*” 形象地表达了这座城市的魅力。
