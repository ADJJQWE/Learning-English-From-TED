#### Chapter 3: Political Parties and the Founders’ Intentions

原文：

From the earliest days of the republic, the architects of the American experiment **harbored deep reservations** about the formation of enduring political parties. Many were determined to avoid replicating what they saw as the ruinous factionalism of European politics. Indeed, the term “faction” itself, employed by James Madison in the Federalist Papers, suggested a pernicious element that could fracture the **body politic**. Yet, despite the Founders’ **apprehensions**, parties emerged early in the nation’s history, driven by the contested policies of the Washington and Adams administrations and the rivalries that arose between figures such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. These developments led to the **ascendancy** of what would become a persistent two-party system. The modern American political landscape, defined by two major parties **wielding** immense institutional power, would present a scenario at once recognizable and **disconcerting** to those who sought to prevent its very birth.

从美国共和国的最早时期开始，美国实验的设计者们**对政党形成深感忧虑**。许多人决心避免重蹈他们所看到的欧洲政治中的毁灭性派系主义的覆辙。事实上，詹姆斯·麦迪逊在《联邦党人文集》中使用的“派系”一词，暗示了一种可能分裂**政治体**的有害因素。然而，尽管创始人们**忧虑重重**，政党还是在国家历史的早期出现了，这一切源于华盛顿和亚当斯政府的政策争议以及亚历山大·汉密尔顿和托马斯·杰斐逊等人物之间的对立。这些发展最终导致了将成为持续的两党制的**崛起**。现代美国的政治格局，由两大党派**掌握**巨大制度权力，呈现出一种对于那些曾试图防止这种局面产生的人而言，既熟悉又**令人不安**的情形。

At the heart of the Founders’ project was a commitment to republican virtue—the idea that enlightened citizen-legislators would place the common good above self-interest, mediating their disagreements through reasoned debate. Many Founders believed that the young republic’s carefully crafted constitutional framework, with its checks and balances and separation of powers, could mitigate the worst effects of factional division. While some divergence in opinion was expected, the prevailing hope was that these structural safeguards would prevent stable alignments from hardening into partisan blocs. The emergence of political parties soon after the federal government was established represented, to many early statesmen, a kind of failure: an indication that narrow interests could overshadow national unity, dragging public policy into a tug-of-war rather than a principled negotiation.

Though the Founders eventually recognized the necessity of some level of political organization, they would be astonished at the degree to which America’s major parties have institutionalized themselves. In today’s climate, each party boasts immense resources: robust fundraising machines, dedicated voter databases, professional campaign strategists, and entrenched networks of influence extending from city councils to the halls of Congress. Control of these organizations—rather than aptitude in statesmanship or depth of philosophical vision—often determines who ascends to positions of leadership. Modern communication technology and media ecosystems have further calcified party loyalties, making the negotiation space that Madison and others envisioned increasingly narrow. Rather than the fluid coalitions that shift according to the issue at hand, we see a near-permanent alignment of party platforms, each defining itself against the other.

In particular, the Founders would likely find it troubling how partisanship can overshadow the pursuit of the public good. As lawmakers rely more on party leadership to raise funds and pass legislation, the incentive to govern with an eye toward bipartisan problem-solving diminishes. The modern primary system—an element unknown to the early republic—empowers the most ardent activists and ideological purists, often penalizing moderation and compromise. The result is that general elections frequently become contests between two rigidly drawn positions, leaving little room for the nuanced middle ground that was once a hallmark of republican deliberation. This stands in sharp contrast to the vision of the Founders who, at their best, hoped that differing factions would be guided by a shared sense of civic virtue, even if they did not always align in policy preference.

Another facet that would likely confound the Founders is the sheer complexity of America’s policy challenges compared to their own era. International commerce, global conflicts, climate change, and intricate financial systems necessitate specialized knowledge and sustained strategic thinking. In such a scenario, disciplined parties do have some constructive role to play by providing clarity and continuity, ensuring that voters understand what policies each side supports. While the Founders might appreciate the organizational coherence that parties bring to complex questions, they would remain wary of the tendency for party interests to overshadow informed deliberation. The danger, from their eighteenth-century perspective, would be that the machinery of modern party organizations could become a tool for narrow interests, stifling dissent and drowning out the voices of ordinary citizens.

The unceasing cycle of electioneering and politicking would also astonish the architects of the republic. Many of them viewed public service as a temporary and dignified calling, not a career defined by permanent campaign mode. The modern era’s perpetual race for power, funding, and media attention stands in stark contrast to the solemn duties of governance they upheld. This might lead them to conclude that the means of retaining power have subsumed the ends for which power was originally sought: the responsible stewardship of a republic based on liberty, equality, and the rule of law.

And yet, it is not entirely certain that the Founders would condemn today’s parties outright. Many Founders were not immune to their own forms of factional maneuvering. Jefferson and Madison themselves, despite initial misgivings, played key roles in mobilizing what became the Jeffersonian Republicans. Over time, some might have admitted that, in a large and diverse nation, political parties can serve to aggregate interests, making governance more manageable and helping voters navigate the complex domain of public policy. They might accept that parties, if held accountable and subjected to the checks provided by free elections and a vigilant press, could serve as a reasonable mechanism for representing the people’s will.

The question becomes: would the Founders, confronted with the modern two-party system, see it as a stable if imperfect channeling of pluralistic interests, or as a broken vessel impeding the deliberate search for the public good? Their reaction might be a mixture of resignation, disappointment, and pragmatic acceptance. They would likely urge reforms to deconcentrate power within the parties and to encourage a more fluid political environment where coalitions could form and dissolve based on the issues at hand. They might call for measures that lower barriers to entry for independent candidates or that reshape congressional procedures to promote cross-party collaboration. These efforts, in their view, would help to restore the ideal of a republic anchored by civic virtue and rational debate, even amidst the inevitable differences that arise in a free society.

In the end, America’s Founders held a vision of a political culture where disagreements would not metastasize into permanent rifts and where leaders would be guided by a sense of honor and duty. Their distrust of entrenched factions and political parties sprang from a profound understanding of human nature and the dangers of unchecked ambition. Faced with the powerful and polarized parties of today, they might lament what they see as an ossification of political life. Yet they would also acknowledge that the American experiment endures, remaining open to renewal, reinvention, and the pursuit of a more inclusive and virtuous public sphere. The challenge for contemporary citizens, then, is to harness that legacy and reshape the political order to reflect the Founders’ highest aspirations rather than their deepest fears.
