## Chapter 4: Economic Power and Corporate Influence 

原文：

In the late eighteenth century, the Founders worked **against a backdrop of** mercantilism, nascent capitalism, and small-scale commerce that revolved primarily around family-owned farms, local artisans, and modest mercantile **ventures**. They viewed economic liberty as a cornerstone of the new republic, an essential ingredient in the grand experiment of self-government. The aim was to ensure that no single concentration of economic or political power could **strangle** the **civic sphere** or dominate public life. Safeguarding an economic environment in which citizens could prosper without succumbing to the dominance of **monied interests** was, in their minds, **part and parcel** of securing liberty. Today’s America, however, is defined by massive corporate conglomerates operating on a global scale, and the interplay between government policy and corporate influence is a far cry from the relatively limited commercial enterprises the Founders knew. Were they to examine modern America’s economic structure, they would have to grapple with this transformation, asking how concentrated economic power might reshape the balance of interests they so carefully attempted to cultivate.

在 18 世纪晚期，美国的创始人在重商主义、资本主义萌芽以及以家庭农场、本地手工业者和小规模商贸活动为主的背景下开展工作。他们将经济自由视为新共和国的基石，是自我治理这一伟大实验中不可或缺的要素。其目标是确保没有任何单一的经济或政治权力能够**扼杀**公民生活或支配公共生活。在他们看来，保护一个经济环境，使公民得以繁荣而不至于屈服于**金钱利益集团**的主导，是保障自由的**核心要素**。

然而，今天的美国以全球规模运作的大型企业集团为特征，政府政策与企业影响之间的互动，与创始人所熟悉的有限商业活动大相径庭。如果他们审视现代美国的经济结构，必然要面对这一转变，并探究经济权力的集中如何可能重塑他们精心设计的利益平衡。

原文：

First, they would likely be struck by the sheer scale of corporate entities. In their era, the largest business ventures—whether shipping houses, early banks, or trade companies—were still confined by geography, capital constraints, and slower methods of communication and production. These enterprises lacked the capacity to reorder entire markets or wield near-sovereign authority over supply chains spanning continents. The Founders understood trade well enough, and some, like Alexander Hamilton, even envisioned a robust commercial republic. However, none could have imagined corporations with multi-trillion-dollar valuations, vast research and development capabilities, and the ability to influence consumer behavior and information flow at a global level. The notion that a handful of private entities could wield influence comparable to nation-states would startle them, pushing them to question the boundaries that separate the public and private spheres.

Second, they would scrutinize the legal frameworks that have granted corporations rights and privileges once reserved for citizens. In the founding era, corporations were chartered by states for specific, limited purposes—building roads, canals, or public works—and their existence was not assumed to be perpetual. Over time, the legal status of corporations evolved, culminating in a broad range of protections for corporate entities. The Supreme Court’s interpretations, which have often extended certain constitutional protections to corporations, would likely puzzle the Founders. To them, the Constitution was a document crafted to secure the rights and liberties of individuals. Recognizing corporations as holders of such rights, particularly when this status allows them to deploy wealth as a form of speech or to influence public policy, would seem like an inversion of the original intentions of constitutional protections.

Third, the Founders would consider the immense influence these economic behemoths exert on public policy. Although special interests existed in the early republic—ranging from landed gentry to maritime merchants—today’s lobbying networks and the financial resources at their disposal dwarf anything the Founders could have imagined. The modern political landscape, where corporate influence helps shape regulations, tax codes, environmental policies, and international trade agreements, would pose a substantial challenge to their vision of representative government. From their eighteenth-century vantage point, the mission was to secure the independence of representatives from undue influence and factional manipulation. The Federalist Papers repeatedly warned of faction and the tyranny of organized interests. If they were to see a political ecosystem in which corporations fund campaigns, sponsor think tanks, and maintain permanent lobbying presences in Washington, they would be concerned that the voice of the ordinary citizen—the yeoman farmer or small merchant of their day—could easily be drowned out.

Fourth, the Founders were not economic egalitarians in the modern sense, yet they believed widespread property ownership was essential to maintaining a virtuous and independent citizenry. They favored an economic landscape in which opportunity was relatively open and not foreclosed by entrenched monopoly. While they accepted that some citizens would be wealthier than others, they also recognized the dangers of an economy dominated by narrow interests. Jefferson, for instance, feared the accumulation of wealth and power by a few would threaten the republican character of the nation. Madison warned about the mischiefs of faction, which can arise from economic disparities. Confronted with corporate giants that can influence wages, employment conditions, and local communities across entire regions, they might fear that the delicate balance between economic opportunity and political liberty had shifted. They would wonder whether economic competition is still genuinely open, or whether the barriers to entry and consolidation of market power stifle the possibility of new entrants shaping the economy from below.

Fifth, the global scope of modern corporations would redefine the Founders’ understanding of the American economy. While they understood trade between nations and sought to protect American commerce on the high seas, they nonetheless imagined a republic whose economic heart lay within its own borders. Twenty-first-century corporations transcend national boundaries in production, supply, and sales, leaving regulators at a disadvantage. Questions of citizenship and loyalty become more complex when a firm’s interests may align more closely with global supply chains or multinational investor demands than with the well-being of the American polity. The Founders might well ask: what happens when national wealth and resources serve global capital markets rather than primarily benefiting the nation’s citizens? This tension between national interests and the imperatives of global commerce would challenge the Founders to consider a modern definition of the “common good.”

Sixth, from the perspective of political economy, the Founders would grapple with how to preserve the spirit of a republic in a landscape of corporate oligopoly. They might suggest reforms reminiscent of their own era’s cautious granting of corporate charters—measures to ensure accountability and transparency. Hamilton, who favored a strong federal government to shape a stable financial system, might agree that some federal oversight is crucial, but he would also demand that any oversight not devolve into cronyism or favoritism. Jefferson, more skeptical of consolidated economic power, might push for antitrust action or incentives for small businesses. Madison might emphasize balancing competing interests, ensuring that corporate influence does not eclipse the rights of individual citizens and smaller communities.

Seventh, the Founders might ask how the ideals they fought for—self-governance, checks and balances, the diffusion of power—could be applied to an economy with a handful of corporate players exerting disproportionate control. They might call for ensuring that corporate influence is channeled through transparent institutions subject to the rule of law. They would also likely emphasize the importance of fostering civic virtue within the business community. In their vision, those who amass wealth carry a responsibility to the republic. Today, corporate social responsibility is often discussed as a voluntary measure, a strategic move to enhance brand image. The Founders might seek a firmer moral foundation, perhaps advocating that those who benefit most from the freedom and stability of the American system are duty-bound to contribute to the common good, rather than pursuing profits at the expense of the polity’s health.

Eighth, the Founders would lament if they found that economic might too readily translates into political advantage. In their writings, they repeatedly emphasized that political power should be won through persuasion, debate, and adherence to constitutional principles, not purchased through massive outlays of capital. They would stress that public policy must rest on the consent of the governed—not be unduly molded by the economic levers that a wealthy minority can pull. The challenge for modern America, in their eyes, would be to uphold the core principle that the government’s legitimacy is derived from the people, not from the heights of market power.

Finally, the Founders would consider potential remedies. They might suggest recalibrating the legal status of corporations, renewing the focus on ensuring that these entities serve public ends. They might also recommend stricter antitrust laws to break up monopolistic power and foster competition. Additionally, they would likely encourage greater political engagement by ordinary citizens, improved civic education around economic issues, and a revival of the spirit that the economy should serve the public interest, not the other way around.

In sum, the Founders would find a vastly different economic landscape in modern America than the one they knew. They would marvel at the technological innovations and the prosperity that large-scale enterprises have brought, but they would also be wary of the power these corporations wield within the political system. They would counsel vigilance, reform, and a reassertion of the principle that political power ought never to be merely an extension of economic might. Instead, it should remain grounded in the consent, judgment, and values of a free and equal citizenry.
